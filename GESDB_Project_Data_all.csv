The new plans contemplated a two stage pumped storage power plant with an upper storage reservoir on the Mooserboden and Wasserfallboden storage lakes above the Limberg Alp. The construction work began with the construction of new and expansion of existing access roads to the construction sites, in particular to the Kapruner Winkel [Kaprun Corner], the building site of the Hauptstufe [main stage] power house, and to the Limberg Alp. When the war ended, the Hauptstufe power house and a makeshift dam on the Wasserfallboden were ready for operation.  Construction of the Oberstufe [upper stage] power house could not begin, however until completion of the Limberg dam, which was to connect airside to the new structure. In the final phase of the work on the barrier, more and more attention was given to the archtectonic design of the Limberg power house. To this end, an invitation to tender was held to design of the crown of dam and powerhouse with architect Harald Bauer's design being selected. For the power house however, the third-placed architect Edith Lassmann's design was selected.  The contract was awarded at the beginning of 1951 and the excavation work for the power house to be attached to the nearly completed dam began immediately thereafter. Between May and August 1951 alone, around 10,000 m³ of rock was removed from the area of the foundations for the new power house. The construction materials were transported via a tow-railway from the Bruck/Fusch station to the Kapruner Winkel and from there taken to the Limberg site with a cement cable railway.  In 1953 the construction work on the main structure was completed. Construction on the stilling basin continued until June 1954 since the final form was not set until after extensive studies and model tests had been carried out by the planning department of Tauernkraftwerke AG.  The first machine set was commissioned on 14 November 1954, the second on1 December 1955. Both of the Möll connecting bridge pumps in the pump cave next to the Drossensperre retaining wall followed on 28 May 1956.  The barracks, equipment and auxiliary cable railway set up for the construction of the dams and power house were removed after construction was completed.","http://www.verbund.com/pp/en/pumped-storage-power-plant/kaprun-upper-stage","Austria","Limberg","null","Salzburg","null","null","47.3648489","12.64","null","01-01-1956","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","null","null","1","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","VERBUND Hydro Power AG","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","15.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","113000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

It is owned and operated by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA). Its construction was in response to growing power demands and a lack of dam sites on the Grand River. The first phase was completed in 1968 and the second in 1971. The upper reservoir for the power station is Lake W. R. Holway which was built on Saline Creek and the lower reservoir is Lake Hudson on the Grand River. During periods of lower power demand, water is pumped from Lake Hudson to Lake Holway and released back down through the pump-generators during periods of high energy demand.  The project was constructed in two stages:  Stage 1 consisted of building an earth and rock filled dam in Chimney Rock Hollow 185 feet (56 m) high, creating Chimney Rock Reservoir. A canal 1,850 feet (560 m) long led from the dam to a forebay structure that had openings for steel penstocks,each 14 feet (4.3 m) in diameter. Three penstocks led from the forebay to a powerhouse that housed three 64,000 horsepower pump-generators, with a total rated capacity of 130 megawatts. This stage was completed in 1968.  Stage 2 comprised building three more penstocks, extending the powerhouse and adding three more pump-generators, all identical to those installed in Stage 1. This doubled the facility's capacity to 260 mw. It was completed in 1971.  The SPSP is controlled remotely from the GRDA Energy Control Center at the Robert S.

A total of ten deep borehole explosions had to be carried out in the excavation of the construction pit. The building is in paint-ready, in-situ concrete, supplemented by prefabricated concrete units, executed and divided into three blocks of roughly equal lengths by means of expansion joints. The roof over the machinery hall comprises prefabricated, reinforced concrete components. The uphill-facing distribution lines were embedded in a solid concrete block.  Strain was nevertheless caused by the encasing in concrete of the pumps and turbine coils, as well as the firm anchoring of the building with the rock. In the surface construction, pillars were covered with concrete at intervals of some 6 m and connected via two 8 or 15 m reinforced concrete girders that lay across the operating floor. The lower girder is connected to the rock by means of high tensile bars; the upper girder serves for slope stabilisation and simultaneously forms the uphill support for the roofing slab. The flat roofs are landscaped with vegetation. The concrete surfaces have a light-coloured interior coating; the floors of the machinery hall and the upper part of the walls are clad with red clinker slabs.

The power station is fitted with six Toshiba turbines, three of which are reversible pump-turbines. All six turbines are equipped with Melco-manufactured generators, and they have a combined generating capacity of 1,500 megawatts (2,000,000 hp) of electricity.   The power station was completed in 1973, and has 150.9 metres (495 ft) rated head. Water is pumped through six pipelines, each 488 metres (1,601 ft) long and 5.6 metres (18 ft) in diameter, delivering water to Talbingo Reservoir.   During 2003, Snowy Hydro commissioned six 140 kilowatts (190 hp) micro-hydro generators on the existing cooling water systems on each of the six generating units at Tumut 3 Power Station. These GreenPower accredited units enable Snowy Hydro to save approximately 3,137 tonnes (3,458 short tons) of carbon dioxide per annum. In addition, this installation not only captures previous wasted renewable energy, but also will be substantially reducing the noise that was associated with the previous pressure reducing valves on the six generating unit's cooling systems. Between 2009 and December 2011, there was a major upgrade of Tumut 3, adding additional capacity in the range of 25 megawatts (34,000 hp) to 50 megawatts (67,000 hp) per unit.","http://www.snowyhydro.com.au/","Australia","Talbingo","null","New South Wales","Talbingo Dam","null","-35.6239558","148.3","null","01-01-1973","null","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","","null","null","null","1","Toshiba","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","Snowy Hydro Limited","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","79.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","1500000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The plant was built between 1969-73 and is jointly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison, and operated by Consumers Energy. The plant contributes directly to local governments about $11 million in annual property taxes.  Revenue from plant operations, maintenance and overhauls also contribute significant sums to the local economy.  Local residents still refer to the plant as “The Project”.  One of the world’s biggest electric “batteries”, Ludington can provide energy at a moment’s notice. Its ability lies in its 27-billion gallon reservoir and a set of six turbines that drive electric generators.  Those same turbines double as giant water pumps to fill the reservoir with water from Lake Michigan. At night, when electric demand is low, Ludington’s reversible turbines pump water 363 feet uphill from Lake Michigan. The water is pumped through six large pipes, or “penstocks”, to the 842-acre reservoir. During the day, when electric demand is high, the reservoir releases water to flow downhill through the penstocks. The flowing water turns turbines and generators in the powerhouse to make electricity. The plant can generate up to 1,872 megawatts — enough electricity to serve a community of 1.4 million residential customers. The output is more than double the capacity of any single unit on Consumers Energy’s system. Ludington’s relatively simple technology enables the plant to respond quickly to the daily, weekly and seasonal highs and lows of Michigan’s energy demand. The plant also saves customers money by enabling Consumers Energy to avoid the expensive spot market when customer demand exceeds the capacity of the company’s baseload plants.  The immense size of Ludington and its six-unit design offers flexibility in balancing customer demand with electric output on a moment’s notice.   Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison announced an $800 million upgrade on February 7 2011. The six year project would begin in 2013 and extend the plant's life by at least forty years and upgrade the generating capacity from 1,872 megawatts to 2,172 megawatts.","http://www.consumersenergy.com/content.aspx?id=1830","United States","Ludington","null","Michigan","null","null","43.894481","-86.44","null","01-01-1973","01-07-1969","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","MISO","null","Public Owned","null","1","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Consumers Energy, Detroit Edison","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","83.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","1872000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

More than 60 crops are grown in the basin and distributed across the nation  Construction of the irrigation facilities began in 1948. Components of the project include the pump-generating plant, feeder canal, and equalizing reservoir, which was later named Banks Lake. Banks Lake was formed by damming the northern 27 miles of the Grand Coulee, and has an active storage capacity of 715,000 acre-feet. The lake stores water for irrigation and also provides important recreational benefits to the region. The pump-generating plant began operation in 1951. From 1951 to 1953, six pumping units, each rated at 65,000 horsepower and with a capacity to pump 1,600 cubic feet per second, were installed in the plant.   In the early 1960s, investigations revealed the potential for power generation. Reversible pumps were installed to allow water from Banks Lake to flow back through the units to generate power during periods of peak demand. The first three generating pumps came online in 1973. Two more generating pumps were installed in 1983; the final generating pump was installed in January 1984. The total generating capacity of the plant is now 314,000 kilowatts. In 2008, the pump-generating plant was renamed in honor of John W. Keys III.

Plans of the Österreichische Bundesbahnen followed after 1945. In 1952, Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG (ÖDK) carried out water and energy-related tests and created a plan for the utilisation of the Malta and Gößbäche with a three-stage power plant group. A dissertation written in 1956 at the technical university in Graz by Erich Magnet with the title 'Winter Storage Plant Inner Maltatal-Kolbnitz' was used by Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG and proved to be very important for the development of the project.  The water rights negotiations for the Malta upper stage and Malta main stage power plants took place in 1964. The approval of the water authorities was granted in 1965. Heavy protests, especially from the Austrian Society for Nature Conservation, followed when the project area lost its nature conservation status. The conservationists called for the erection of nuclear power stations as an alternative to storage power plants. The detailed planning commenced in 1971 following the positive construction decision.  In addition to covering demand peaks, it was required that the power plant group Malta must, at all times, be in a position to provide reserve power for a failed nuclear power plant. The earlier-than-expected issuing of the building decision and the new requirements created major challenges for the planning and construction departments. In addition, the first machine unit for the main stage was to be commissioned two years earlier than expected on 1 December 1978. The planning was carried out, inter alia, by Construction Director Kurt Baustädter, Rudolf Mußnig, Kurt Landl, Heiner Ludescher and Georg Lichtenegger from Draukraftwerke AG. External planners, such as the civil technology company Ehß, were also engaged. The architectural work was carried out by Rudolf Nitsch from Klagenfurt.  After a series of geological tests, the final location for Rottau power plant was fixed in 1973. The excavation pit reached a depth of approximately 30 metres below the valley basin and 25 metres below the groundwater level. Extensive safety measures were necessary to prevent the penetration of groundwater. The first machine unit was commissioned in Rottau power plant in late autumn 1976. The storage pumps were commissioned in summer 1978. The capacity of 730,000 kW corresponds to the capacity Zwentendorf nuclear power plant would have had.","http://www.verbund.com/pp/en/pumped-storage-power-plant/malta-main-stage","Austria","Rottau","null","Carinthia","null","null","46.87241","13.33","null","01-01-1979","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","null","null","1","null","null","null","Allgemeinen Elektricitätsgesellschaft (AEG) and Alpen-Elektrowerke AG (AEW)","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","VERBUND Hydro Power AG","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","123.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","730000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The decision by Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG (ÖDK) to construct the three-stage Malta power plant, however, did not follow until 1957. The power plants comprise an upper stage with Kölnbrein reservoir and Galgenbichl power house, the main stage with Galgenbichl reservoir in the upper Malta valley between Gamskarnock and Lausnock, the main stage power house in Rottau near Kolbnitz in the Möll valley as well as the lower stage with a diversion channel in the Möll valley and Möllbrücke power house in the Drau valley.  Given that it had only been established for a short time, ÖDK did not, however, have the financial resources necessary to construct the Reißeck, Kreuzeck and Malta power plants at the same time. For this reason, detailed planning did not commence until 1961 following the completion of the Reißeck-Kreuzeck power plants. In 1965, the Malta-Upper Stage and Malta-Main Stage projects were approved by the water authorities.  The construction work for Galgenbichl power house followed after commencement of work on the Kölnbrein Dam and the Galgenbichl reservoir. The construction warehouse was extended in April 1974 and work on the development of the construction site commenced. Machinery and equipment from the neighbouring construction site at Galgenbichl Dam were used during the construction period.  The excavation work commenced in the east section of the power house, and due to the tight time schedule, continued through winter 1974/75. The work to stabilise the 40-metre cliff to the west of the power house to which parts of the building are attached proved to be a major challenge. An external firm was commissioned to supply and prepare 800 tons of twisted ribbed steel so as to save time by working parallel. In spite of weather-related delays, work on the assembly of the first machine commenced on 1 September 1975 and the assembly of the second machine followed in 1976.  The power house was handed over to ÖDK on 1 September 1976. The finishing work continued until spring of the following year.","http://www.verbund.com/pp/en/pumped-storage-power-plant/malta-upper-stage","Austria","Malta Hauptstufe","null","Carinthia","null","null","47.0791667","13.34","null","01-01-1979","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","null","null","1","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","VERBUND Hydro Power AG","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","124.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","120000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

It is a construction with daily water accumulation that participates in the functioning of the frequency regulation and of the distribution of electricity to the grid. This hydraulic structure consists of four parts: an upper and a lower reservoir, penstocks and a power station. The lower reservoir was created by means of damming up the valley of the Čierny Váh by a 375 m long dam. Its capacity is 5.1 million m3. The level fluctuates by 7.45 m between elevations 726.00 – 733.45 m. The upper reservoir of an irregular shape is situated between the valleys of the Biely Váh and the Čierny Váh. It has a maximum capacity of 3.7 million m3 of water and the level fluctuates by 25 m between the elevation points 1160 – 1135 m above sea level. The sealing of the slopes and of the bottom is provided by one layer of asphalt concrete sealing blanket with a surface of approximately 200,000 m2. Underneath the reservoir, there is an inspection tunnel that should collect the potential seepages from the reservoir bottom and slopes. The hydraulic connection of the upper and lower reservoir is ensured via three pressure penstocks which have an internal diameter of 3.8 m. In the valley, they split into pipes that transport the water to the two turbines and outlets of water from the two accumulation pumps. The maximum head between the upper and the lower reservoirs is 434 m. The lower reservoir dam includes also a power station with a control room. There are six pumping turbo aggregates installed that comprise a motor generator, a Francis turbine and an accumulation pump. When 6 accumulation pumps are in operation, it takes 8 hours to pump the water into the upper reservoir.

Elbert, Colorado’s highest peak.  Mt. Elbert is the only federal powerplant on the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project and is largest hydroelectric power plant in Colorado. It began operations in 1981.  The Mt. Elbert Pumped-Storage Powerplant  is an all-concrete structure equivalent to a 14-story building. Most of the structure is below ground. Water from the Forebay above drops through two penstocks 445 feet to the powerplant where two turbine-generators develop 200,000 kilowatts of electrical power. Mt. Elbert’s two units are also designed to operate as a 170,000-horsepower electric motor to drive the turbines in reverse and pump the same water back up to the forebay.

It is located 14 km (9 mi) north of Numata. It creates the upper reservoir for the 1,200 MW Tamahara Pumped Storage Power Station (玉原発電所). Construction began in 1973 and the dam was complete in 1981 while the power station was commissioned in 1986. It is 116 m (381 ft) tall and withholds a reservoir with a storage capacity of 14,800,000 m3 (11,999 acre·ft). Of that capacity, 13,000,000 m3 (10,539 acre·ft) is active (or useful) for power generation. The lower reservoir for the pumped-storage power station is created by the Fujiwara Dam, located 4 km (2 mi) to the northwest on another Tone River tributary. Power is generated during periods of high energy demand and pumping occurs during times when energy demand is low such as at night. The power station contains four 300 MW reversible Francis turbine pump-generators which serve to both pump water and generate electricity. The upper Tamahara Reservoir is at an elevation of 1,177 m (3,862 ft) and the lower Fujiwara Reservoir is at 651 m (2,136 ft) which affords the power station an effective hydraulic head of 518 m (1,699 ft). When pumping, the pump-generators can move up to 210 m3/s (7,416 cu ft/s) of water and when generating, they discharge up to 276 m3/s (9,747 cu ft/s).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamahara_Dam  http://www.jepic.or.jp/en/data/EPIJJapanData.pdf  http://www.suiryoku.com/gallery/gunma/tanbara/tanbara.html","http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/useful/pdf-3/12i_full-e.pdf","Japan","Tone-gun","null","Gunma Prefecture","Fujiwara Azaootonekokuyurin","null","36.7862665","139.16","null","01-01-1982","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Tokyo Electric Power Company","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","144.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","1200000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The dam's power plant contains 2 x 211 MW pumped-storage generators than can generate power in the normal way by allowing water to flow through its turbines. However, during periods when the demand for electricity is low (such as evenings, weekends, or during seasonal fluctuations), the dam can use its excess power generating capacity to pump water back into the reservoir—enhancing reservoir capacity and storing water for periods when the demand for electricity is high. At the time it was constructed, the Aldeadávila Dam had the largest pumping station in Europe.   The Aldeadávila Dam has two diversion tunnels, each 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in length. Each tunnel has a 53-metre (174 ft) high surge tank. The dam also contains more than 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of tunnels which divert water to the electrical generation turbines. There are six penstock tunnels, each about 5 metres (16 ft) in diameter. The design of the penstocks and auxiliary spillways using these tunnels has proved to be an issue, however. Cavitation problems have damaged these tunnels in the past. Until the Alcantara Dam was built in 1969, the Aldeadávila Dam was the largest hydroelectric power plant in Europe. As of 2010, it remains the largest in Spain.

With the ratcheted demand pricing, the month with the highest energy usage sets the annual peak demand charge. In 2013, the annual peak demand charge was set in August at $37,479. The charge is ratcheted at 80 percent, which means that for the 11 months following August, JCPenney pays a demand charge of $29,983 (80 percent of $37,479). This applies unless a new peak demand is set, in which case the process starts over.   The other significant demand charge that JCPenney’s Headquarters incurs is called a Transmission Cost Recovery Factor, also known as a 4CP or coincident peak demand charge. The 4CP is determined by averaging a customer’s demand during the highest grid-wide peak hours of peak demand in each of the four summer months, June through September.

It is named for the two streams, Bad Creek and West Bad Creek, which were dammed to create the Bad Creek reservoir.  The Bad Creek facility utilizes two reservoirs (or lakes) to generate electricity: an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir. Water stored in an upper lake is released into underground power tunnels. The water rushes down the tunnels, driving huge turbines, which are underground at the base of a dam. The spinning turbines are connected to large generators, which produce the electricity. The water then flows through draft tubes into a lower lake.  A pumped-storage hydroelectric station uses the same water over and over again, making more efficient use of water resources. When demand for electricity is low, operators can refill the lake, as if they were “recharging” a battery. Using power from other generating stations, the generators act as electric motors spinning the huge turbines backward. This pumps water back up the power tunnels into the upper lake. Water is generally pumped back to the upper reservoir at night and on weekends.  With the reservoir at full-pond elevation and generating with all four units, Bad Creek can generate for 24 hours within its maximum 160’ drawdown.

New Waddell Dam's primary purpose is to store Colorado River water for CAP use. The dam also stores Agua Fria River runoff and provides flood protection by controlling river flows. The dam is located one-half mile downstream of historic Waddell Dam, which was built by the Maricopa Water District (MWD). The dam's reservoir, Lake Pleasant, also stores water for MWD irrigation.  In the winter, Colorado River water is pumped uphill from the CAP aqueduct into Lake Pleasant when power rates are low. In the summer, when demand for water and electricity increases, water is released through the Pump-Generating plant, producing hydroelectric power that is sold to help repay the CAP's construction costs. In addition, New Waddell Dam adds 7,000 surface acres to the lake, greatly increasing the recreational value of Lake Pleasant Regional Park.  Handicapped-accessible recreational facilities include 3 multiple-lane boat ramps, 450 picnic sites, 225 campsites, 14 group use areas, 4 overlooks, a full-service marina equipped to handle 1000 boats, and 7 miles of trail. Because the reservoir water level may fluctuate up to 125 feet during a typical year's operation, the facilities will be located to be accessible during both high and low water periods.  If necessary, floodwaters can be released from the dam through the river outlet works tunnel into the Agua Fria River immediately below the dam.

The grid had ongoing stability issues, and routinely had frequency and voltage excursions that could only be controlled by aggressive load-shedding, unless new generation was added to provide regulation and stability. The choices for new generation included fast-acting combustion turbines or battery energy storage. PREPA's analysis showed that battery energy storage systems offered superior operational benefits due to their faster reaction times, both for frequency regulation and spinning reserve requirements.  The comparable slower response times of combustion turbines required more installed capacity, whereas the faster reaction time of a battery system meant that a much smaller battery could offer the same functionality as larger sizes of combustion turbines. Typically, battery systems can reach full operating power in less than 1 second, whereas mechanical systems such as combustion turbines need several seconds to minutes to reach their full power output. The seemingly small difference in reaction times translates into very large consequences for the stability of the electric grid, where events that lead to outages propagate within cycles, and a difference of 1 min translates to a complete blackout under some conditions. Thus, it was shown that battery systems were a more cost effective option compared to combustion turbines because a smaller battery could outperform a much larger block of combustion turbines. This is particularly applicable to an 'island' system, where there is no interconnection with a neighboring system to balance the momentary shortage of generation resources during an operational contingency.  The PREPA battery was patterned after the BEWAG battery in application as well as battery type. Valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries were commercially available by the time the PREPA battery project was started, but PREPA chose a flooded, flat-plate cell because it had a proven track record at BEWAG. However, once utility operations began in 1994, the battery was cycled more frequently than planned, which caused the battery to age more rapidly than expected. This use led to positive-plate growth, which caused cell / jar cracks, leaks, short circuits, and ultimately early battery failure.  PREPA made the decision in 2001 to repower, or replace, the battery. A tubular positive plate, flooded battery was selected, and the new battery was installed in mid-2004. Several problems occurred, however, and the system was taken out of service.","http://goo.gl/9YI8t6","United States","San Juan","null","Puerto Rico","Sabana Llana Substation","null","18.3978052","-66.01","01-01-1989","01-11-1994","01-07-1992","01-12-1999","null","NO","Primary Distribution","null","","null","State/Municipal Owned","null","1","C&amp;D Technologies","General Electric (GE)","Leeds &amp; Northrup, Applied Control Systems","Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA)","Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA)","Aireko","United Engineers &amp; Constructors","null","Utility-Owned","null","Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA)","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","200.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lead-acid battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","20000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Beginning operation in 1997, the MP&amp;L BESS has a 1 MW peak power output, and 1.4 MWh energy capacity. It is capable of supporting continuous loads of 800 kilovolt amperes (kVA), pulse loads up to 1200 kVA, and consists of 378 Absolyte VRLA 100A75 modules. Nearly 5 MW of hydroelectric generation capacity provides almost all of MP&amp;L’s power, with a 3.3 MW diesel generation system relegated to reserve duty. MP&amp;L’s two hydroelectric plants, Purple Lake and Chester Lake, have reservoir storage capacity, though the hydro generators were too slow to respond to sudden load fluctuations. At the time of the BESS’s initial operations, the MP&amp;L peak load was approximately 4 MW. A lumber mill in Metlakatla (since closed down) caused large, sudden power spikes on the community’s islanded power system, and the BESS was installed to provide fast response for the mill’s rapid load changes.  The MP&amp;L BESS is housed in a purpose-built 40-foot by 70-foot steel butler building that sits on a cement pad. Installation cost of the 1 MW / 1.4 MWh Exide Metlakatla BESS was $1.6 million in 1996 dollars (estimated cost in 2009 dollars: $2.2 million). The battery system became operational in February 1997. It operated continuously for 11.5 years until September 2008, when the battery was replaced with a new VRLA product. The VRLA battery exceeded its 8-year design life by over 3 years. The BESS is estimated to have saved MP&amp;L over $6.5 million over its life in reduced fuel consumption and maintenance, in addition to reduced greenhouse emissions. A new battery was installed with the support of the Alaska Commerce, Community, and Economic Development Agency, so the BESS will continue to provide benefits to the community for many years to come. Spent battery cells will be sent to a lead-acid battery recycling plant in Quebec.","http://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/events/VanuatuJuly2012/7_Srinivas_Bharadwaj.pdf","United States","Metlakatla","null","Alaska","3.5 Mile Airport Rd.","99926","55.0845439","-131.58","null","03-02-1997","null","null","null","NO","Primary Distribution","null","","null","Cooperative (Customer Owned)","null","1","Exide","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Metlakatla Light & Power","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","217.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lead-acid battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","1000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Traditional alternatives to add capacity and improve service in this area are costly and environmentally difficult, so that PacifiCorp has sought viable alternatives to meet these goals.

In 2005, Sumitomo Electric International (Osaka, Japan) was contracted to install a vanadium flow battery system at the existing 30.6 MW Tomamae Wind Villa on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. The primary intent of the battery system is to provide “wind smoothing” for the intermittent and variable wind plant.  The facility has operated well since 5 January 2005, sometimes performing over 50 charge-discharge cycles per hour. By acting as a rapid source and sink for the sometimes highly variable wind energy production, this facility has reduced the ramping rates of the wind farm’s output with respect to the rest of the island’s grid by reducing the peaks and valleys of the wind farm energy output.   The project is located on a Tomamae Town managed stock farm.  Scenery and farm land utilization is preserved by burying the power cables and installing transformers in the turbine towers. The energy storage facility is configured with 16 modules rated at 250 kW each, which gives the entire facility 4 MW with 6 MWh of storage (90 minutes).  Pulse power of 6 MW exists, but only for 20 minutes.  The project was developed and is owned by J-Power, the largest electric utility in Japan. While moving into wind generation, J-Power produces most of it’s electricity from coal-fired and hydroelectric power plants. Other J-Power wind generation projects include the 65.98 MW Koriyama Nunobiki-kogen Wind Power Plant, 24.75 MW Nikaho Highland Wind Project, 21 MW Green Power  Kuzumaki Wind Farm, and the 22 MW J-Wind Tahara plants.","http://www.sandia.gov/ess/EESAT/2007_papers/0018.pdf","Japan","Tomamae","null","Hokkaido","null","null","44.3060399","141.65","null","01-01-2005","null","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","J-Power","null","null","null","null","null","Federal/National","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","247.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Flow battery","Vanadium redox flow battery","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","4000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Virtua Health, located in New Jersey, has partnered with VYCON to install a VDC140 Flywheel Energy Storage System at the Virtua Health data center. This installation is one of high visibility for both companies as it is in a critical application. Performance of the system is monitored remotely from VYCONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offices in California. The system was installed and has been in operation since mid-December. The modern power system at Virtua HealthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gibbsboro facility utilizes Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) that protect their servers from utility power disturbances. Automatic Transfer Switches (ATS), that detect loss of utility power, command the Generator sets on site to automatically start during power outages. The VDC140 is in operation with a UPS to provide ride-through power while the generator starts during a power loss or disturbance, keeping the servers on-line. The VDC140 at Virtua Health operates in parallel with Lead Acid Batteries.

A PowerStore grid-stabilizing system and DCS power management solution oversees the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power supply, which consists of seven 320 kilowatt (kW) low-load diesel generation units combined with three 200 kW wind turbines. PowerStoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 500 kW flywheel technology enables the wind turbines to supply up to 95 percent of Coral BayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energy supply at times, with a total annual wind penetration of 45 percent, while maintaining city grid standards of power stability and quality. Power station data indicates more than 80 percent of Coral BayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power is wind generated for one-third of the year. The data also shows that for nearly 900 hours per year, wind provides more than 90 percent of Coral BayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power supply. PowerStore maximizes an environmentally friendly solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PowerStore is a compact and versatile flywheel-based grid stabilizing generator. Its main purpose is to stabilize power systems against fluctuations in frequency and voltage. It includes state-of-the-art inverters and virtual generator control software. It enables the integration of intermittent and often erratic renewable generation and the higher utilization of renewable energy generators, protecting remote communities from exposure to volatile oil prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore safeguards conventional microgrids, and ensures the safe integration of large amounts of wind and solar energy, reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. High-speed software controls the power flow into and out of the flywheel, essentially making it a high inertia electrical shock absorber that can instantly smooth out power fluctuations generated by wind turbines or solar arrays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore acts like a STATCOM (advanced grid technology that quickly stabilizes voltage and improves power quality) and in addition is capable of rapidly absorbing or injecting real power within an isolated power network. It can stabilize both voltage and frequency, hold 18 MWs (megawatt seconds) of energy and shift from full absorption to full injection in 1 millisecond to stabilize the grid.&lt;/p&gt;","http://new.abb.com/power-generation/references/providing-coral-bay-with-high-quality-power","Australia","Coral Bay","null","Western Australia","null","null","-23.1410266","113.7764051","null","01-01-2007","01-01-2007","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","ABB","ABB","null","null","null","null","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","Verve Energy","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","262.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Flywheel","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","500","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

In addition, the chilled water pressure drop through the tank was specified to stay below 3 psi even in the event that the pumps were to require a delivery flow rater of 5,184 gpm which is the maximum flow rate to the building.  Poole &amp; Kent, the mechanical contractor, provided the new chilled water piping, pumps, and valves in addition to overseeing the installation of this TES tank. DN Tanks together with Poole &amp; Kent worked closely with the owner and engineers in ensuring that the TES system was constructed within the agreed upon schedule, and commissioned expeditiously so that the data center would be protected with this reservoir of chilled water.  In August of 2007, representatives of the owner, the mechanical contractor, the engineer, and DN Tanks commissioned the TES system. The commissioning process included shutting down all chillers during the middle of a weekday of the data center operation. Immediately upon shutting down the chillers, the new TES system was energized and chilled water from the TES tank became the sole source of cooling for the facility.

A live islanding event, meanwhile, took place in December 2009, during a snowstorm that islanded 25 customers for two days. Over that period, the Milton installation was able to minimize disruptions; customers experienced less than three minutes of continuous disruption during the two-day outage period.  Finally, on October 20, 2009, the Milton, WV battery was successfully operated to alleviate load and voltage concerns during a load transfer event between substations. While the transformer at one station was taken out of service for maintenance, load was transferred to a different station which caused voltage and loading concerns.

They have always relied completely on fossil fuels for power and heating, until a new system based on wind turbines, a new distributed control system and PowerStore grid-stabilizing technology was commissioned in 2009. The bases still need back-up diesel generators, but three 333 kilowatt (kW) wind turbines reduce the amount of diesel required for power generation by around 463,000 liters, and cut CO2 emissions by 1,242 metric tons per year, while lowering the risks of transporting and storing liquid fuel in this precious environment. A frequency converter interconnects the Scott and McMurdo bases, which operate at different frequencies - 50 Hz (NZ) and 60 Hz (US), allowing power flow in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PowerStore is a compact and versatile flywheel-based grid stabilizing generator. Its main purpose is to stabilize power systems against fluctuations in frequency and voltage. It includes state-of-the-art inverters and virtual generator control software. It enables the integration of intermittent and often erratic renewable generation and the higher utilization of renewable energy generators, protecting remote communities from exposure to volatile oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore safeguards conventional microgrids, and ensures the safe integration of large amounts of wind and solar energy, reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. High-speed software controls the power flow into and out of the flywheel, essentially making it a high inertia electrical shock absorber that can instantly smooth out power fluctuations generated by wind turbines or solar arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore acts like a STATCOM (advanced grid technology that quickly stabilizes voltage and improves power quality) and in addition is capable of rapidly absorbing or injecting real power within an isolated power network. It can stabilize both voltage and frequency, hold 18 MWs (megawatt seconds) of energy and shift from full absorption to full injection in 1 millisecond to stabilize the grid.&lt;/p&gt;","http://new.abb.com/power-generation/references/ross-island-research-station","Antarctica","Ross Island","null","South Pole","null","null","-77.5247401","166.96","null","01-01-2009","null","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","ABB","ABB","null","Meridian Energy","null","null","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","New Zealand Antarctic Institute","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","284.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Flywheel","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","500","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The projects include more than 2,000 solar modules and a solar tracking system that follows the path of the sun throughout the day. When the sun is shining, PowerStore grid-stabilizing technology and DCS power management solution ensures maximum solar energy (100% peak penetration) goes into the network by lowering diesel generation, up to the minimum loading of the generation units. When the sun is obscured, the PowerStore covers the loss of solar power generation as the DCS ramps up the diesel generation, so the network has an uninterrupted energy supply. The solar energy systems generate over 1 gigawatt hour (GWh) of renewable energy per year, supplying 60 percent of the average daytime energy for both towns, saving 405,000 liters of fuel and 1,100 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PowerStore is a compact and versatile flywheel-based grid stabilizing generator. Its main purpose is to stabilize power systems against fluctuations in frequency and voltage. It includes state-of-the-art inverters and virtual generator control software. It enables the integration of intermittent and often erratic renewable generation and the higher utilization of renewable energy generators, protecting remote communities from exposure to volatile oil prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore safeguards conventional microgrids, and ensures the safe integration of large amounts of wind and solar energy, reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. High-speed software controls the power flow into and out of the flywheel, essentially making it a high inertia electrical shock absorber that can instantly smooth out power fluctuations generated by wind turbines or solar arrays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore acts like a STATCOM (advanced grid technology that quickly stabilizes voltage and improves power quality) and in addition is capable of rapidly absorbing or injecting real power within an isolated power network. It can stabilize both voltage and frequency, hold 18 MWs (megawatt seconds) of energy and shift from full absorption to full injection in 1 millisecond to stabilize the grid.&lt;/p&gt;","http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/38567a1472ea578fc1257e8a0030a70d.aspx","Australia","Marble Bar","null","Western Australia","null","null","-21.16493","119.741631","null","01-01-2010","01-01-2010","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","","null","State/Municipal Owned","null","1","ABB","ABB","null","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Horizon Power","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","302.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Flywheel","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","500","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The SWER power lines were first utilised after WWII because they offered a simple, low cost power solution by supplying power through a single wire and circulating it back via the earth.  Currently however, the SWER power line network suffers from poor voltage regulation, poor power factor and overload capability.  The GPSS-SWR consists of a single phase rugged IGBT bi-directional inverter, and 100 kWh of Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries.

Pumped storage hydroelectric power plants, which pump in water during low-demand evening hours and use it to generate power during peak hours, have become the mainstream of hydroelectric power generation in recent years in Japan.  http://www.kyuden.co.jp/var/rev0/0041/7746/dx84stsj4_all.pdf","http://www.jepic.or.jp/en/data/EPIJJapanData.pdf","Japan","Miyazaki","null","Miyazaki","null","null","31.9076736","131.42","null","01-07-2011","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","Hitachi Mitsubishi Hydro Corporation","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Kyushu Electric Power Company","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","350.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","1200000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Due to passing clouds, solar energy output was observed to rapidly fluctuate; cases were observed where over 80% of a solar unit's output would drop in less than five seconds.  This rapid fluctuation in circuit power flows can cause undesirable voltage conditions that are significant for existing infrastructure to correct. To solve this, a battery system was envisioned that charged and discharged to absorb the solar-induced 'power swings', allowing the circuit's voltage profile to remain smooth despite significant and rapid changes to the power flows along it.   Duke has arranged 12 batteries manufactured by the Italian company FIAMM for use in series in hybrid electric buses to make a 402-kilowatt battery. It is used to smooth out large minute-by-minute spikes and troughs in production from the 1.2-megawatt rooftop solar project Duke operates about a mile away.  The Rankin project is designed to give Duke hard data on what would be the smallest battery that could be used to reduce these swings effectively.  FIAMM donated the battery to Duke to participate in getting the information. Dan Sowder, Senior Project Manager in Duke's Emerging-Technology Office says the Italian company is designing products for use with solar projects, based on the information it gets from the Rankin project.","http://www.duke-energy.com/news/releases/2013020701.asp","United States","Mount Holly","null","North Carolina","Rankin Avenue Retail Substation","28120","35.2981943","-81.02","null","01-12-2011","null","01-12-2014","null","NO","Primary Distribution","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","FIAMM Energy Storage Solutions","null","S&amp;C Electric Company","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Duke Energy","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","369.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Sodium-based battery","Sodium-nickel-chloride battery","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","402","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The system has functioned, and continues to function as predicted with no indication that it will not tolerate well beyond 10 calendar years and 10,000 cycles. It has been in continuous operation for more than 1 year with 1,000 cycles (of varying depth of discharge, including 100% depth of discharge) and no identifiable degradation to the system. The final thick electrode cell structure has shown an energy density of 25 kWh/m3 at a five hour (or greater) discharge time. The primary chemistry has remained non-toxic, containing no acids or other corrosive chemicals, and the battery units have passed numerous safety tests, including flame resistance testing. These tests have verified the claim that the device is safe to use and contains no hazardous materials.  Current projections show costs at the pack level to offer best in class value and are competitive with lead-acid batteries, factoring in LCOE.  The final deliverable system for the DOE award was assembled in late 2011 and testing began shortly thereafter. This system consists of 270 Battery 0 units connected in series, with a footprint of 45 x 58 x 60 (LxWxH) and weighing approximately 2800 lbs. It should be noted that a significant portion of this weight and footprint is a temporary racking system that allows for varying pressure to be placed on the batteries to test for gassing and a conductivity issues.

Harry Hobbs, IHG's Western Area Director of Engineering, was looking for a way to tackle high demand charges due to load spikes, which are not addressed through standard energy efficiency measures.   After hearing about the Stem system, Harry decided to deploy systems in both San Francisco InterContinental hotels.  Harry was able to take advantage of the California Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) to cover 60% of the system installation cost.  Stem's solution was installed in November 2012 and immediately began leveraging the proprietary combination of big data, predictive analytics, and energy storage to effectively 'hybridize' the hotels by intelligently switching between battery power and grid power to reduce energy costs.    Independent verification of results was conducted by corporate staff using a third party revenue-grade meter and simulated load.  As a result, IGH has committed to purchasing Stem systems for is California portfolio of 16 hotels in 2013, with a projected savings of $2.2 million over the next 10 years.","http://www.stem.com/customers","United States","San Francisco","null","California","888 Howard St.","94103","37.7820694","-122.4047431597","null","01-09-2012","null","null","null","NO","Secondary Distribution","null","CAISO","null","Investor Owned","null","1","CODA Energy","Stem","null","Stem","null","null","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","InterContinental Hotels San Francisco","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","416.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","15","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The innovation started in the tidy development of Stones Throw in East Stroudsburg, where developers had installed identical ETS units in the 1980′s and ’90s, making it a perfect place to pilot VCharge’s technology. Now, over 40 Stones Throw homeowners, and nearly another 100 in the surrounding area, have installed free controls on their ETS heaters to participate in this radical experiment in grid storage and energy management–and to get a 25% discount on their home heating bills.  By itself, any individual heating system is relatively unremarkable. But together, the 134 homes in VCharge’s Aggregated Transactive Load Asset (ATLAS) create a huge resource for grid balancing–specifically providing ancillary services like fast frequency response through the markets run by PJM. This reservoir of capacity, both to cut load on the system (effectively generating negawatts) and to absorb rapid influxes of energy (for example from a sudden surge from a solar or wind farm) means that grid operators have a powerful new tool in their belts to deal with the coming demands of a shifting energy mix.","http://vcharge-energy.com/projects/","United States","East Stroudsburg","null","Pennsylvania","null","null","40.9995386","-75.18","null","01-10-2012","null","null","null","NO","null","null","PJM","null","null","null","1","VCharge, Inc.","VCharge, Inc.","VCharge, Inc.","VCharge, Inc.","VCharge, Inc.","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","VCharge, Inc.","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","422.1","Thermal energy storage","Heat thermal storage","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","2010","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

(MHI), jointly with Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution (SHEPD), has begun an energy storage system demonstration project using the distribution grid in the UK's Orkney Islands, which has a high penetration of renewable energy. The project aims at demonstrating power supply stabilization in the region by introducing a container-housed large capacity energy storage system using lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, with a power output/input capability of 2MW (megawatts). The storage system will be handed over for operation in the middle of 2013.   The demonstration project is conducted with the support of New Energy and Industrial Technology Development organization (NEDO) of Japan, under the ''Development of Technology for Safe, Low-cost, Large-size Battery System'' programme. In the project, Mitsubishi Power Systems Europe, Ltd. (MPSE), the business base for MHI's power system operations in Europe, will jointly provide the energy storage service to Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution plc (SHEPD) The funding for the project is being provided to SHEPD from OFGEM, under it's Tier 1 Low Carbon Network Fund.  The energy storage system, which has the capacity to store approximately 800kWh (kilowatt hour) nominal, 500kWh normal usage, consists of two 40ft containers for the batteries and a 40ft container for the power conditioning system. Each battery container houses more than 2,000 units of lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and its management system. The power conditioning system container houses a system for conversion of direct current (DC)/alternating current (A/C) and the associated input/output controls.  The energy storage system will be installed at SHEPD's Kirkwall Power Station. In the cases of power shortage or power surplus on the Orkney Islands, power is transmitted from/to the mainland through two 33kV submarine cables. When there is too much renewable energy, exceeding the export capacity of the cable to the mainland, the energy storage system will import part of the excess energy, reducing the need to constrain renewable generation on the islands, by reducing or stopping generator export.'   http://www.all-energy.co.uk/__novadocuments/86694?v=635673060322170000","http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/orkney-hosts-uks-first-2-mw-energy-storage-trial_100012415/#axzz3hOSyEyI3","United Kingdom","Kirkwall","null","Orkney","null","null","58.984674","-2.96","01-11-2012","01-06-2013","null","null","null","NO","null","null","SHEPD","null","null","null","1","Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.

These two feeders serve the planned FortZED Jump Start Zone (Ft. Collins Zero Energy District, in which the district creates as much thermal and electrical energy locally as it uses). This project will modernize and transform the electrical distribution system of the City of Fort Collins by reducing distribution feeder peak loads, increasing the penetration of renewables, and delivering improved efficiency and reliability to the grid and resource asset owners.   Fort Collins is well positioned to successfully complete this project due to 1) the unique combination of world-class research facilities at Colorado State University, 2) participation of global industry leaders and local entrepreneurs able to commercialize the technology, 3) the City of Fort Collins’ focus on and investments in clean energy as a key pillar of future growth, and 4) the presence of a city-owned utility and extensive community support.  As a small portion of this project, thermal storage will be installed at the following sites:  Site 1: New Belgium Brewing -- deploys new 200-kW PV arrays with AE inverters; a 292-kW methane-based Gauscor CHP; a 650-kW CAT 3508C methane-based CHP; a 135-kW new thermal storage; and a 160-kW load shedding potentials.  Site 2: City of Fort Collins Facilities -- deploys a 500-kW conventional generator with Woodward controls and Eaton switchgear; a 92-kW thermal storage; a 5-kW PV array; a 62-kW HVAC and DSM; and 2x10kW Ford Escapes (PHEVs).  Site 3: Colorado State University - deploys an 80-kW thermal storage; an 80-kW fan variable speed drives; a 21.6-kW water fountain pumps; a 3.6-kW hot water heater controls; a 6-kW daylight control, and a 950-kW conventional gensets with Woodward controls and Eaton switchgear.","http://www.newbelgium.com/Sustainability/Environmental-Metrics/Energy","United States","Fort Collins","null","Colorado","500 Linden St","null","40.59335825","-105.0678421818","07-06-2010","01-09-2013","null","null","null","NO","Primary Distribution","null","","null","Public Owned","null","1","Ice Energy","null","Spirae","null","null","null","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","City of Fort Collins","null","null","null","null","null","Federal/National American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ RD&amp;D","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","473.1","Thermal energy storage","Latent heat","Ice","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","135","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Other specific aspects of sub-projects include: distribution circuit constraint management, enhanced circuit efficiency and power quality, self-healing circuits, deep grid situational awareness, and end-to-end cyber security and interoperability. The demonstration will be conducted in Irvine, California and will include two 12kV distribution circuits fed by SCE’s MacArthur Substation, residential homes, and EV charging in a parking lot at the University of California, Irvine.  Fourteen residential energy storage units (RESUs) have been installed as part of the Irvine Smart Grid Demonstration (ISGD). Each RESU contains a 4 kilowatt inverter and 10 kilowatt-hours of LG Chem Ltd. automotive-grade lithium-ion batteries, with a total capacity of 56 kW. The RESU provides backup to secure loads in the event of an outage, and couples up to 4 kW of photovoltaic solar panels with the battery. These systems combine a number of control mechanisms to allow valuation of various operating or control modes. The RESUs communicate with SCE SmartConnect Meters and a remote RESU Server to gather published prices, instantaneous demand, Demand Responses, and utility control information. Throughout the two-year demonstration project, the RESUs will be operated in six different operating modes to investigate their value on the customer’s energy usage and SCE’s distribution circuit.

A thermal salt storage facility means that electricity can still be generated after the sunset in summer months almost round the clock.  With an output of 50 MW, Arenales went on stream at the end of 2013 after a construction time of two years. It supplies around 50,000 Spanish households with environmentally friendly electricity.

The objective of the project was to quantify how a microgrid comprised of distributed energy resources (DERs) that include solar PV, EV charging infrastructure, stationary li-ion energy storage and a ﬂeet of Chevy Volts could deliver an economic “beneﬁt stack” sufﬁcient to enable scalable, microgrid business models.  The project tightly integrates the performance of the various DERs within the microgrid via TimberRock’s Distributed Energy Resources Management System (DERMS) called De-MAP. De-MAP serves as the integration platform for both the DERs and the external management systems. The DERs are aggregated and managed as a single block of capacity allowing them to “straddle the meter” and be dispatched to deliver value to both the host site – delivering cost-effective energy and reducing demand charges – and the grid by providing services like frequency regulation.  The project represents the ﬁrst commercial deployment of OnStar’s Smart Grid solutions which allows EVs to be integrated with a microgrid and directly managed as grid-interactive resources. PJM, the grid operator, was heavily involved with the project since its inception and the Maryland Energy Administration has awarded the project their prestigious Game Changer award.","http://timberrockes.com/docs/TRES-MEA.pdf","United States","White Marsh","null","Maryland","null","21162","39","-76","null","10-07-2013","10-07-2013","null","null","NO","null","null","PJM","null","null","null","1","TimberRock Energy Solutions Inc.","null","TimberRock Energy Solutions Inc.","TimberRock Energy Solutions Inc., GM, OnStar","null","null","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","General Motors","null","null","null","null","null","State/Provincial/Regional Grant","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","529.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","30","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The high Alpine project area for the pumped storage power plant Reisseck II is located in Mühldorfer Graben at a height of up to 2,300 metres (m) where the Great Mühldorfer Lake will later function as an upper basin. The cavern power plant Reisseck II will be erected 1,585 m above sea level in the mountain and equipped with two powerful pump turbines.  Similar to a normal storage power plant, Reisseck II will produce peak electricity in high demand periods, whereby water will be transported via a works water channel from Great Mühldorfer Lake to the two turbines that drive the generators. The processed water will run into a lower basin.  Both of the machines units in the mountain can be switched to pump operation, whereby the generators will then function as motors and the turbines will pump the water from the lower basin back up to the upper basin. Pump operation will take place during the day when the European grid is carrying more electricity than is required by the consumers. Energy which, for example, comes from the large wind farms or the Danube power plants can be saved in the form of pumped-up water. The pumped storage power plant Reisseck II will therefore function as a 'green battery' in the Alps. The power plant will have a capacity of 430 megawatt (MW), both in turbine and pump operation. This corresponds to the electricity generating capacity of approximately 200 wind turbines.  On completion of the rock cavern for the power plant in 2011, the boring of the works water channel to Great Mühldorfer Lake commenced in the first half of 2012 with an 880-ton (t) and 220 m tunnel boring machine. The assembly work on Austria's largest power plant construction site commenced in summer 2012. 300 experts are currently working on this high Alpine site. The newest VERBUND pumped storage power plant Reisseck II will be commissioned in 2014. The total investment volume amounts to € 385 million.  A 200-ton transformer works its way up to Reisseck power plant  In the project Reisseck II, assembly work is going full speed ahead. Of all power plant components, the block transformer with a tare weight of 200 tons is the heaviest single component.  The transformer was delivered to Spittal on the river Drau by rail. Several tractive units harnessed in front of the transformer heaved it from the Mölltal valley to the power plant cavern, located 1000 meters higher – a logistic challenge!  http://www.power-technology.com/projects/reisseck-ii-pumped-storage-power-plant-carinthia/?goback=%2Egmp_3698324%2Egde_3698324_member_5812132009241239554#%21","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta-Reisseck_Power_Plant_Group#Reisseck-Kreuzeck_power_plants","Austria","Kölnbrein Dam","null","Carinthia","null","null","47.0791667","13.34","null","01-01-2014","01-08-2010","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","null","null","1","null","Andritz","null","VERBUND Hydro Power AG","null","Poyry Energy","HPC","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","VERBUND Hydro Power AG, KELAG, ENERGIE AG","null","null","null","null","European Investment Bank ($202m)","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","543.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","430000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

This commercial scale storage system, built on Yume-shima Island, Osaka, will begin operating in February 2014. Over the next three years, the system will measure the smoothing effect of energy output fluctuation from the nearby “Hikari-no-mori,” solar farm, and will aim to establish a large-scale power storage technology by safely and effectively utilizing the huge quantities of discarded used EV batteries which will become available in the future. This project has been selected as a model project for 'Verification of the battery storage control to promote renewable energy' for the fiscal year 2013 by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan.  Sumitomo Corporation created the joint venture company, “4R Energy Corporation”, in collaboration with Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. in September 2010, to address the secondary use of EV lithium-ion batteries. The used EV batteries that will be recycled into this large-scale storage system have been recovered and have gone through thorough inspection and maintenance at 4R, to confirm safety and performance. This prototype system (0.6MW/0.4MWh) consists of sixteen used EV batteries.  Battery Business Development Department General Manager, Norihiko Nonaka said “We are pleased to be a part of such an important verification project that can both utilize used EV batteries, and provide a large-scale power storage facility, which are important issues that need to be addressed for the future of renewable energy.”  Sumitomo will seek new business opportunities which can make use of the highly economical storage system, as well as work on developing new applications for used EV batteries. The company aims to actively promote this approach, which can both contribute to expanding the use of EV and encourage the use of renewable energy. Sumitomo is willing to participate in the movement toward lowering the carbon footprint of a sustainable society.","http://www.sumitomocorp.co.jp/english/","Japan","Yumeshima Island","null","Osaka","null","null","34.6937378","135.5","null","01-02-2014","01-04-2014","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","null","null","1","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","Sumitomo","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","546.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","600","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The project is based at SCE’s Monolith Substation in Tehachapi, California and includes a 32 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) and the associated power conversion system. The project will evaluate the performance of the BESS to improve grid performance and assist in the integration of large-scale variable energy resourced generation. Project performance will be measured with 13 specific operational uses:   1. Provide voltage support and grid stabilization 2. Decrease transmission losses 3. Diminish congestion 4.  Increase system reliability  5. Defer transmission investment 6. Optimize size of new renewable-related transmission 7. Provide system capacity and resource adequacy 8. Integrate renewable energy (smoothing) 9. Shift wind generation output 10. Frequency regulation 11. Spin / non-spin replacement reserves 12. Ramp management 13. Energy price arbitrage.   Most of the operations either shift other generation resources to meet peak load and other electricity system needs with stored electricity, or resolve grid stability and capacity concerns that result from the interconnection of variable energy resources.

The district will install solar and DemandLogic™, SolarCity's smart energy storage system for businesses, to generate and store its own clean, renewable electricity at eight schools. DemandLogic will allow the district schools to reduce energy costs by using stored electricity to lower peak demand. SolarCity will install the district's solar systems and advanced battery technology at eight elementary and middle schools, as well as additional solar generation at a district office. The solar installations will total more than 1.4 megawatts of clean power capacity, with storage providing an additional 360 kilowatts (720 kilowatt hours) of power to reduce peak demand. The new solar systems are expected to save the district more than $1 million dollars over the life of the contracts, and the DemandLogic battery storage systems could save thousands more on demand charges each year. Burton School District retained TerraVerde Renewable Partners, an independent energy advisor, to assess and scope an optimal energy cost savings program, analyze financing options, organize the RFP process and help the district select the best candidate to meet the program's specifications. The new SolarCity systems are expected to generate 2.3 million kilowatt hours of solar energy annually, and enough over the life of the contract to power more than 4,000 homes for a year. The solar systems will also help avoid more than 43 million pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and save more than 203 million gallons of water*, an especially important environmental benefit in the drought-stricken valley.

In the demonstration project, which is aiming toward the commercialization of the system, the durability of the battery energy storage system was an especially important concern.   Hitachi Chemical Company, Ltd., the developer of the lead batteries, has more than 10 years' experience in delivering devices to reduce power fluctuation. The company has been researching and analyzing batteries for longevity and has accumulated a knowledge base on the improvement of battery performance. In the Izu Oshima Island demonstration, Hitachi has also evaluating the durability and performance of the battery energy storage system through deterioration analysis utilizing data from Hitachi Chemical Company, Ltd. Further, Hitachi is creating control systems to monitor the operational status of the battery energy storage system for the demonstration project, not just for onsite monitoring but also for remote monitoring from the TEPCO's Oshima Power Plant at Izu Oshima Island in Tokyo and Hitachi's Omika Works in Ibaraki Prefecture. Hitachi is striving to develop control technology from research and analysis of the data for the operation of battery energy storage systems.  As Izu Oshima Island has been relying on diesel power generation, one of the purposes of this demonstration project is to evaluate the effect of using the battery energy storage system in reducing fuel costs. Hitachi is looking to find economical solutions to improve power grids in other island regions that have been relying on fossil fuels for their power supply.

The goal is to deliver a cost-effective prototype flywheel system that can be grid connected and electrically charged and discharged. The system will have built-in sensing components that can determine frequency and voltage characteristics of the grid and can override the grid signal to manage the amount of electricity discharged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flywheel stores energy in a spinning rotor that is connected to an electric motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. To recover the energy the motor is electrically reversed and used as a generator to slow down the flywheel converting the mechanical energy back into electrical energy. Amber Kinetics will improve the traditional flywheel system by engineering breakthroughs in three areas, resulting in higher efficiency and radically reduced cost: magnetic bearings, low-cost rotor, and high-efficiency motor generator. This technology can also be used to optimize existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 48-month project contains 3 phases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase 1: engineering of a 10 kW / 10 kWh prototype system, includes demonstration of flywheel system, rotor performance, and demonstration of low-loss bearings and motor (Completed)&lt;/p&gt;

As a part of the expansion of the central plant (built by PPC Mechanical Contractors), a new 890,000 gallon chilled water Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tank was designed and built by DN Tanks.  The performance criteria for the tank was specified by P2S Engineering and included a useable TES capacity of 10,000 ton-hours and a maximum chilled water flow rate of 2,400 gallons per minute. Integrated into the campus district cooling system, the tank provides cooling for the campus during the peak electric period of time during the afternoon, allowing the chiller equipment to de-energize during this time, which permanently reduces the campus’s electric demand. Utilizing the TES tank, the peak-demand electric load of the campus will be reduced by 1,100 kW’s.

If the voltage frequency of the regional electric grid suddenly dropped, power producers like TEP would be required to quickly ramp up output to boost frequency and maintain reliability.   The systems also can help prevent power outages during periods of high energy demand by supporting stable voltage on TEP’s energy delivery system.

The facility will be built by Chicago-based E.ON Climate &amp; Renewables and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017.  The systems will be used primarily to help maintain the required balance between energy demand and supply. Energy storage systems can boost power output levels more quickly than conventional generating resources. If the voltage frequency of the regional electric grid suddenly dropped, power producers like TEP would be required to quickly ramp up output to boost frequency and maintain reliability.   The systems also can help prevent power outages during periods of high energy demand by supporting stable voltage on TEP’s energy delivery system. In the event of an outage, the systems could provide about 5 MW of power for up to an hour. Use of these energy storage systems will help TEP avoid using more expensive generating resources for system disturbances. They also will allow the company to defer costly investments in other system infrastructure.","https://www.tep.com/news/newsroom/release/?idRec=444","United States","Tucson","null","Arizona","null","null","32.2217429","-110.93","03-05-2016","01-03-2017","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","null","null","null","E.ON Climate and Renewables","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Tucson Electric Power","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","735.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","Lithium-ion titanate battery","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","10000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The island of Tilos is currently supplied with oil-based generated electricity via an undersea cable from the island of Kos. Its annual electricity consumption is in the order of 3 GWh and its peak demand, during summetime, reaches approximately 1 MW. The existence of the undersea cable allows for the investigation of the interplay between an interconnector and energy storage, and of energy trade strategies between a smart microgrid (Tilos island) and a macrogrid (the electricity system of Kos).   In this context, the main objective of TILOS is the development and operation of a prototype battery storage system, based on NaNiCl2 batteries, that will be provided with a smart grid control system and that will cope with the challenge of supporting multiple tasks. These tasks range from microgrid energy management, maximization of RES penetration and grid stability, to export of guaranteed energy and provision of ancillary services to the main grid of Kos. The battery system will support both grid-forming (stand-alone microgrid) and grid-following (microgrid coupled with the main grid) operation and will also prove its interoperability with the rest of microgrid components, including centralized RES (800 kW wind turbine and 160 kW PV power), demand side management (DSM), and distributed, residential heat storage in the form of domestic hot water.","http://www.tiloshorizon.eu/","Greece","Tilos Island","null","South Aegean","null","null","36.4230663","27.37","01-02-2015","01-07-2017","01-02-2017","null","null","NO","Primary Distribution","null","","null","Public Owned","null","1","FIAMM Energy Storage Solutions SRL","Indrivetec AG","EUNICE Laboratories SA","null","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","TILOS consortium partners","null","null","null","null","null","Federal/National Grant","null","Private/Third Party","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","743.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Sodium-based battery","Sodium-nickel-chloride battery","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","800","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Tesla boss Elon Musk has made good on his promise to build the 100-megawatt facility on deadline or provide it free after blackouts last year that critics of the state’s Labor government blamed on pro-renewable policies.  The battery had begun dispatching some power into the state’s electricity network on Thursday afternoon as temperatures rose above 30C.  The state’s premier, Jay Weatherill, flicked the switch at Jamestown on Friday, saying it was history in the making. “I want to express my gratitude to the workers who have constructed this battery, they have every right to be proud of what they have constructed,” he said in a statement.  The project grew out of a Twitter bet between Australian software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Telsa and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. In response to Cannon-Brookes’ incredulity about the speed that Tesla was claiming it could install grid-tied batteries, Musk promised to deliver a system to South Australia, a state that’s suffered debilitating blackouts in recent summers, “in 100 days or its free.”","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-power-tesla/tesla-switches-on-giant-battery-to-shore-up-australias-grid-idUSKBN1DV3VR?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=newsOne","Australia","Jamestown","null","South Australia","null","null","-33.205278","138.6","07-07-2017","01-12-2017","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","null","null","1","Tesla","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Neoen, South Australian Government","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","752.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","100000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Environmentally friendly hydroelectric power is well suited to Japan's unique topographical characteristics and climate, which provides abundant rainfall. Although hydroelectric power was once a main source of energy, the ratio of hydroelectric to thermal power has been reversed since 1959. Hydroelectric power plants can quickly be adjusted, and this makes hydroelectricity ideal for the role of compensating for potential shortfalls to meet peak demand. Pumped storage hydroelectric power plants, which pump in water during low-demand evening hours and use it to generate power during peak hours, have become the mainstream of hydroelectric power generation in recent years in Japan.  http://www.fepc.or.jp/english/energy_electricity/location/hydroelectric/  http://www.hepco.co.jp/english/environment/pdf/report2008.pdf  http://www.jepic.or.jp/en/data/EPIJ2012Japan%20data.pdf","http://www.hepco.co.jp/english/environment/pdf/report2008.pdf","Japan","Kyogoku","null","Hokkaidō","null","null","42.8582077","140.88","null","01-01-2020","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Hokkaido Electric Power Company","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","780.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","200000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites.  When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.","http://www.ice-energy.com","United States","Redding","null","California","1540 Charles Dr Ste B","96003","40.5863563","-122.391675","null","07-15-2013","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","Public Owned","null","1","Ice Energy","null","Ice Energy","Ice Energy","Ice Energy","Ice Energy","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Confidential","null","null","null","null","null","State/Provincial/Regional","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","817.1","Thermal energy storage","Latent heat","Ice","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","10","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

As a result, 65 ESS in the SWARM pilot project were allowed to immediately contribute to stabilization of the power grid. The joint project by the technology and system supplier, Caterva GmbH, and by the Nuremberg community utility N-ERGIE Aktiengesellschaft, is supported by a grant of the State of Bavaria. Siemens AG is a technology partner.  The special feature of the large-scale virtual storage system is the networking of the storage units of household size. The ESS feature lithium-ion storage batteries. Siemens delivers the power electronics system.  Each ESS is provided with its own control unit, so that it can react on a stand-alone basis to grid frequency. The ESS, installed in private households, are connected via the UMTS network, with the control center at Caterva, which coordinates the households as a swarm. The control center acquires the latest individual data on storage-charging levels of the ESS and regulates the swarm such that the FCR, also known as frequency regulation or balancing power, on offer is actually available. At the TenneT control station, the data are forwarded online. The N-ERGIE power plant control station is responsible 24 by 7 for operator control and supervision of the large-scale virtual storage system, as it is for its own power generating facilities.   Double benefits for households  The beneficiaries of the ESS developed by Caterva – each with a total output rating of 20 kW and a capacity of 21 kWh – are the operators of private roof-top PV installations. Thanks to the storage systems, these users can cover 60 to 80 % of their power requirements from their own solar systems – and can at the same time contribute to German energy transition (Energiewende) by providing balancing power.  As a result of the considerably larger storage-battery capacity of the ESS in comparison to conventional PV buffer-storage, participation in the FCR market means no restriction to users in the consumption of the energy that they themselves have generated.   The first 65 ESS installations are distributed throughout the entire distribution system area of N-ERGIE, which is over 8,000 km² in size.   Contribution to grid stability  With provision of positive and negative FCR, the swarm enhances grid stability. Power balancing is necessary to compensate for the imbalance in power generation and consumption in such a way that grid frequency remains constant at 50 hertz. Balancing power is provided by transmission system operators in three specifications: FCR, Frequency Restoration Reserve, and Replacement Reserve (minute balancing power).  Demands placed on FCR are the strictest, since it must be provided within 30 seconds. Before Restoration and Replacement Reserve power, FCR is supplied directly proportionally to the deviation of grid frequency by each ESS.   Swarm Energy Storage Systems satisfy strictest requirements  The ESS swarm system has impressively fulfilled all requirements. The lithium-ion storage batteries installed in the ESS units enable a reaction period of just a few seconds. The large-scale virtual power storage system therefore balances fluctuation in the power grid within seconds and provides a key contribution to system stability.","http://swarm.bayern","Germany","Nuremberg","null","Bavaria","null","null","49.45203","11.08","01-04-2014","07-15-2015","null","null","null","NO","null","null","TenneT","null","null","null","1","Caterva, Saft, Siemens","null","null","Caterva, N-ERGIE","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","Caterva","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","818.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","1300","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Opened by the Queen in October 1965, it is one of four pumped storage power schemes in the UK, and has the distinction of being the world's first high head reversible pumped-storage hydro scheme. The station has also been used as the setting for several films, including the James Bond film The World is not Enough.  Nicknamed The Hollow Mountain, Cruachan was constructed between 1959 and 1954 and is unique in that the station is concealed within the hollowed out rock of Ben Cruachan, 3,694 feet (1,126 m), which overlooks the visitor centre. It was conceived and designed by Sir Edward MacColl, a Scottish engineer and a pioneer of hydro electricity in Scotland, with numerous projects to his credit. The only visible features are the dam, which is 1,000 feet (316 m) wide and located 1,300 feet (390 m) up the mountain, and the station offices and visitor centre, which lie on the loch side below the dam, and next to the road.  Buried in the mountain and accessed by a tunnel 23 feet (7 m) wide and 13 feet (4 m) high, the main cavern houses four motor-generator sets capable of generating a total output of 440 MW. Construction of the main cavern, similar in size to a football pitch, required the excavation of 220,000 cubic metres of rock and soil.  The station can operate for 22 hours before the supply of water in the reservoir is exhausted, and is required to maintain a 12 hour emergency supply in reserve. Figures given for the Foyers scheme show that the system can raise 167 tonnes of water (167 cubic metres) per second when pumping at full power, with the flow rate increasing to 200 tonnes per second when generating at full power.","http://www.visitcruachan.co.uk/","United Kingdom","Lochawe","null","Dalmally","null","null","56.406482","-5.11","null","10-15-1965","null","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","","null","null","null","1","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","Scottish Power","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","829.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","440000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The system allows homes and businesses to take their electricity needs entirely off the grid. It represents a major breakthrough in controllable unit technology and is a genuine first-in-the-world solution. The MPS is groundbreaking as it permits up to three simultaneous natural inputs (solar, wind and hydro) with a single inverter – no additional controllers or complicated wiring are required. If natural energy stores are low, the MPS can also charge from the grid at night, storing power in off-peak periods to save the user money. The system achieves incredible efficiency as it has the capability to intelligently control both input and output currents, depending on specific energy needs. It is completely portable, can be retrofitted to existing solar panels, and has a short return on investment timeframe.  NRG Green Co installed a 15 kW inverter mini power system inside the Tanna Island Community Clinic above the battery bank to convert the stored energy into usable 240V AC for use for medical equipment, lights, USB power points etc. This is supplemented by a 1.5 KW scroll type wind turbine.

Total capacity is 3,200 MWh.  The power station fulfills static, dynamic and compensatory functions within the power system. The static function lies in converting the surplus energy in the system into peak-load energy - at periods of surplus electricity in the system, namely at night, water is pumped from the lower to the elevated storage reservoir; and during the on-peak periods, when there is a shortage of electricity, the power station’s turbines generate electricity. The dynamic function of the hydroelectric power station means functioning as the system’s output reserve, generating the regulating output and energy, and participating in the frequency regulation of the system. The compensatory operation facilitates the voltage regulation within the power system.  The lower reservoir is on the Divoká Desná River, 820 m above sea level.

The proposed SolarCity project next to KIUC’s Kapaia power plant is believed to be the first utility-scale system in the U.S. to provide dispatchable solar energy, meaning that the utility can count on electricity being available when it’s needed, even hours after the sun goes down.  The 52 MWh battery system will feed up to 13 megawatts of electricity onto the grid to “shave” the amount of conventional power generation needed to meet the evening peak, which lasts from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. By using the solar energy stored in the battery instead of diesel generators, KIUC will reduce its use of imported fossil fuels and also cut its greenhouse gas emissions.","http://www.solarcity.com/newsroom/press/kaua%CA%BBi-utility-signs-deal-solarcity-first-dispatchable-solar-storage-system","United States","Kaua'i","null","Hawaii","null","null","21.9661076","-159.57","10-09-2015","02-22-2016","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","Cooperative (Customer Owned)","null","1","Tesla","null","SolarCity","null","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","SolarCity","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","930.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","13000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Taft Gardens was challenged to preserve the pristine natural environment of the gardens while at the same time generating and harvesting enough off-grid power to accommodate expanding operations at this remote location. California Solar Electric originally designed and installed an off-grid hybrid solar power generation and storage solution that would eliminate trenching power lines and dramatically reduce generator use and fuel consumption for the eco resort.   Phase one of the off-grid solar plus storage system involved the installation of eight PHI2.6 kWh batteries (48 v) to provide over 20 kWh of stored power for the facilities' main lodge and three separate living quarters. A year later, it was evident that the solar PV generation exceeded both the resort's daily electricity loads and the battery storage capacity. Increasing the battery storage allowed them to capture all their PV generation and store more power for evening loads in order to maximize their capital investment - all off grid.","https://www.entelligent.com/news/2016/03/22/simpliphi-power-and-california-solar-electric-expand-energy-storage-capacity-at-taft-botanical-gardens-eco-resort/","United States","Ojai","null","California","null","null","34","-119","null","03-22-2016","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","null","null","1","SimpliPhi Power","null","California Solar Electric","California Solar Electric","California Solar Electric","California Solar Electric","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","Conservation Endowment Fund","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","931.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","Lithium-iron phosphate battery","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","10","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites. When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.","http://www.ice-energy.com","United States","Burbank","null","California","164 W.

The dam's spillway is controlled by seven radial gates, which, along with four regulating conduits at the bottom of the dam, give the dam a total maximum discharge of 112,000 cubic feet per second (3,200 m3/s). Hiwassee Lake stretches along the river for approximately 22 miles (35 km) to the town of Murphy, North Carolina, and has 180 miles (290 km) of shoreline, a storage capacity of 434,000 acre·ft (535,000 dam3) and 205,590 acre·ft (253,590 dam3) of flood storage. The reservoir's operating level varies by roughly 38 feet (12 m) in a typical year.  During the 1950s, TVA experimented with the idea of 'pumped storage' at Hiwassee Dam. There it employed an energy-generating turbine that was run in reverse during low-demand hours to pump water below the dam into the upper reservoir. This integration of pump and turbine was the first of its kind in the United States; further, at the time it was the largest and most powerful in the world. The unit was built by Allis-Chalmers Company.

The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites. When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.","http://www.ice-energy.com","United States","Moreno Valley","null","California","27200 Eucalyptus Ave","92555","33.936265","-117.18646","null","03-25-2013","null","null","null","NO","null","null","CAISO","null","Public Owned","null","1","Ice Energy","null","Ice Energy","Ice Energy","Ice Energy","Ice Energy","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Confidential","null","null","null","null","null","State/Provincial/Regional","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","963.1","Thermal energy storage","Latent heat","Ice","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","20","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

It draws its energy from the force of the tide by using a tidal barrage. Instead of damming water on one side like a conventional dam, a tidal barrage first allows water to flow into a bay or river during high tide, and releasing the water back during low tide. This is done by measuring the tidal flow and controlling the sluice gates at key times of the tidal cycle. Turbines are then placed at these sluices to capture the energy as the water flows in and out.  The station's 24 reversible bulb pump-turbines are used to pump water into the river basin at high tide (for ebb generation). This energy is more than returned during generation, because power output is strongly related to the head. If water is raised 2 ft (61 cm) by pumping on a high tide of 10 ft (3 m), this will have been raised by 12 ft (3.7 m) at low tide. The cost of a 2 ft rise is returned by the benefits of a 12 ft rise. This is because the correlation between the potential energy is not a linear relationship, but rather, is related by the square of the tidal height variation.","http://energie.edf.com/hydraulique/energies-marines/carte-des-implantations-marines/usine-maremotrice-de-la-rance/presentation-51516.html","France","La Richardais","null","Ille-et-Vilaine","Rance Tidal Power Station","null","48.6180022","-2.02","null","11-26-1966","null","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Électricité de France (EDF)","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","988.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","240000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

After much consultation and consideration, the decision was made to install the 135kWh Powerwall 2 array to avoid what would have been a very expensive grid upgrade.

In between the two plants is a forebay capable of holding about 740 million gallons of water; behind the Lewiston plant, a 1,900-acre, 22 billion gallon reservoir holds additional supplies of this liquid fuel. Water is diverted from the Niagara River—up to 375,000 gallons a second—and conveyed through conduits under the City of Niagara Falls to Lewiston. From there, water flowing through the Robert Moses plant spins turbines that power generators, converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy. At night, when electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units operate as pumps, transporting water from the forebay up to the plant's reservoir. During the daytime, when electricity use peaks, the Lewiston pumps are reversed and become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant. In this way, the water can be used to produce electricity twice, increasing production and efficiency. To balance the need for power with a desire to preserve the beauty of Niagara Falls, the United States and Canada signed a treaty in 1950 that regulates the amount of water diverted for hydroelectricity production. On average, more than 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), or 1.5 million gallons of water a second, flow from Lake Erie into the Niagara River. The 1950 pact requires that at least 100,000 cfs of water spill over the Falls during the daylight hours in the tourist season, April through October. This flow may be cut in half at night during this period and at all times the rest of the year. *** Update on progress of facility upgrade: https://www.nypa.gov/NYPAPressCenter/PressRelease/News/NYPA%20Completes%20Upgrade%20on%20First%20of%2012%20TurbineGenerator%20Units%20at%20Niagara%20Plant%E2%80%99s%20Lewiston%20PumpGenerating%20Facility.html</p>","http://www.nypa.gov/facilities/niagara.htm","United States","Lewiston","null","New York","5477 Military Rd.","null","43.142984","-79.02","null","01-28-1961","03-18-1957","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","NYISO","null","Public Owned","null","1","Hitachi","null","null","null","null","Ferguson Electric","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","New York Power Authority (NYPA)","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1003.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","240000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

It can operate as an independent power source or in support of the traditional electric grid, adding resilience while lowering energy costs.   The system includes two natural gas-fired microturbines that deliver onsite electrical power and heat generation. During winter months, heat is recovered from the microturbines to support climate control for the World Headquarters, the largest office building in Kansas. A geothermal heat pump system with 15 wells each drilled 500 feet deep also helps heat and cool the Pavilion. The microgrid system also uses battery technology to capture and store energy from generation resources and deliver electricity to the headquarters during times of high electric demand.  The microgrid is capable of producing about 1,300 megawatt hours of power annually. It has three rooftop solar photovoltaic panel groups—monocrystalline, polycrystalline and AC modules that use micro inverters. They provide 50 kilowatts (kW) of electricity at their peak output. The two natural gas-fired microturbines deliver 130 kW of power generation. A 100 kWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system is used.

When a ship’s anchor ruptured the underwater power lines in 1950, that linked the island to San Francisco, Alcatraz was forced to turn to diesel fuel and coal as its source of power. This has led to power costs of $0.76/kWh.   Microgrid Design:  This project reflects the National Park Service’s initiative to find an alternative way of powering the island in order to reduce fuel costs and pollution. A microgrid system, comprised of PPS inverters, a solar array, advanced lead-acid batteries, a PPS Site Controller, and back-up generators, was selected as a way to independently power the island. Designing and building the system on one of California’s and the U.S.’s most well-known historic landmarks with over 1 million visitors per year, created many challenges.   Component Placement: Preserving the island in pristine condition while completing the installation was the greatest challenge. Given that a system of this size requires a large construction effort, component placement was key. To prevent the solar array from being visible from San Francisco, it was placed on the roof of the prison in a flat configuration rather than a traditional angled configuration. The inverters, battery rack, and generators were placed in the old generator room, as this space is isolated and not accessible for tourists. The room was also protected from the harsh salt water environment.

SCE’s existing diesel generating capacity must be constantly cycled to accommodate the varying system load. One of the major consequences of cycling the diesel generators is operating the units at less-than-optimal Nitrous-Oxide (NOx) emission operating points.  In response to diesel engine emission reviews at PBGS, the 2009 SCE-SCAQMD settlement agreement directed SCE to install a 1 MW / 7.2 MWh NGK Insulators sodium-sulfur battery system to help stabilize the generation fluctuations. The battery project was completed in 2013 in partnership with S&amp;C Electric. It provides the necessary energy storage capacity during off-peak periods, and energy supply capacity during on-peak periods, to allow for steady operation of the diesel generators at fixed, minimum emission operating points. Additional benefits include improved system voltage regulation, system stability, and system reliability.","https://www.sandc.com/globalassets/sac-electric/content-callouts/solutions/edoc_075872.pdf","United States","Avalon","null","California","Pebbly Beach Road","90704","33.3397913","-118.31","null","07-30-2012","01-07-2011","null","null","NO","Primary Distribution","null","CAISO","null","Investor Owned","null","1","NGK Insulators Ltd.","S&amp;C Electric Company","S&amp;C Electric Company","null","null","S&amp;C Electric Company","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Southern California Edison","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1035.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Sodium-based battery","Sodium-sulfur battery","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","1000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites. When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.","http://www.ice-energy.com","United States","Fontana","null","California","10661 Business Dr.","92337","34.0598626485","-117.5092537877","null","09-30-2013","null","null","null","NO","null","null","CAISO","null","Public Owned","null","1","Ice Energy","null","Ice Energy","Ice Energy","Ice Energy","Ice Energy","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","Confidential","null","null","null","null","null","State/Provincial/Regional","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1043.1","Thermal energy storage","Latent heat","Ice","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","20","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The Generation Cycle begins at Llyn Stwlan - Ffestiniog's upper reservoir. Large screens inside the intake towers are opened to activate the high-pressure downflow.  27 cubic metres of water per second are discharged through two high-pressure shafts (each 200 metres in depth), which are connected to four concrete-lined tunnels. Steel penstocks then direct the discharge into the station via inlet pipes and valves to start generation.  Water is captured in Tan-y-Grisiau and pumped back to Llyn Stwlan, usually overnight, to complete the cycle.

The scheme was redeveloped to focus on pumped-storage in 1969, having been purchased by the Hydro Board from the British Aluminium Company (BAC). The scheme was originally built by BAC in 1896 and was the first large-scale commercial hydro-electric scheme in the UK, used to power an aluminium smelter also located here until this closed in 1967. BAC created a reservoir by joining two small lochs to form Loch Mhor, which lies 179 m above Loch Ness and 2 miles away.  During the redevelopment, a 5 MW turbine was installed in the original power station building to replace the original plant and provide pure hydro-electric generation, while the tunnels and pipes which carried the water were reused. The River Fechlin was diverted into Loch Mhor to provide additional water and, to support the pumped-storage system, new tunnels and a further power station were built.  A new power station was built to house two 150 MW Francis generation-motor sets, each weighing 914 tonnes, with 5 m wide turbine blades. 100 cubic meters of water pass through each turbine and out into the loch every second during generation. The turbines can be brought from a standstill to full power output in less than two minutes, which makes the station extremely responsive to demand. The new scheme became fully operational in 1975.  The scheme has a total capacity of 305 MW and is run by Scottish &amp; Southern Energy Plc.","http://www.scottish-places.info/scotgaz/features/featurefirst3852.html","United Kingdom","Loch Ness","null","Highland","null","null","57.3228575","-4.42","null","12-31-1974","null","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","Scottish and Southern Energy","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1068.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Pumped hydro storage","Open-loop PHS","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","300000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The demonstration area includes 150 square miles including parts of Columbus, Bexley, Gahanna, New Albany, Whitehall, Reynoldsburg, Westerville, Blacklick, Johnstown, Alexandria, Minerva Park, and Pataskala. This area includes approximately 110,000 meters and 70 distribution circuits. AEP Ohio will implement Smart Grid technology over 58 13kV circuits from 10 distribution stations and 12 34.5kV circuits from six distribution stations. Included in this project is a redistribution management system, integrated volt-VAR control, distribution automation, advanced meter infrastructure, home area networks, community energy storage, sodium sulfur battery storage, and renewable generation sources. These technologies will be combined with two-way consumer communication and information sharing, demand response, dynamic pricing, and consumer products, such as plug-in hybrid vehicles.  The plan was to integrate 80 CES (25kW/25kWh) units of storage resources into the existing grid. After initial testing, AEP Ohio began field installations and commissioned 15 CES units into operations by December 31, 2011. Following this deployment, technical issues were discovered and the CES units were not performing to AEP Ohio’s stringent standards. The CES units were removed from the field and returned to S&amp;C. This component of the project has been redefined to include a limited deployment of four CES units at an outdoor test environment on AEP Ohio property to continue extensive testing.

In nuclear storage systems, heat can be stored in these materials at night and released to produce electricity during daytime peak-demand hours.   Halotechnics new thermal storage material targets a price that is potentially cheaper than the molten salt used in most commercial solar thermal storage systems today. It is also extremely stable at temperatures up to 1200°C--hundreds of degrees hotter than the highest temperature molten salt can handle. Being able to function at high temperatures will significantly increase the efficiency of turning heat into electricity.

The system utilizes power more efficiently by absorbing energy generated during the braking of railcars, storing it in the lithium-ion batteries via the converter and then supplying it to railcars during acceleration. The stored energy is also used to stabilize the overhead contact line voltage. Using regenerative power in this way ensures the safer operation of railcars and acts as an energy-saving measure by reducing railcar electricity consumption.

A hub of humanitarian efforts in eastern Africa, Lokichogio (or simply Loki, as it is often called) hosts United Nations offices, a hospital run by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and approximately fifty NGOs. Given the region’s rural location near the border of south Sudan, its incorporated NGOs, and the surrounding communities are often reliant on generators for electrical power. Aiming to provide solutions to Loki’s power concerns, ZeroBase was recently awarded a contract to supply hybridized microgrid generation and storage systems for a one-hundred-kilowatt installation in the region, utilizing Princeton Power Systems’ Microgrid technology.  Princeton Power Systems (www.princetonpower.com) is a New Jersey-based designer and manufacturer of products for energy storage, conversion, and management. Princeton Power Systems shares ZeroBase’s goal of enabling safe and sustainable energy use through the development of practical technology. While the customer currently has diesel generators, the project will incorporate adding PV, lead acid batteries, and a generator to the Micro-grid system.  Clearwater Industries, Ltd. is also working with ZeroBase in the Lokichogo region. Operating out of Nairobi, Clearwater Industries is a renewable energy company involved in the development, marketing, and distribution of hybrid energy solutions. As a conduit for ZeroBase’s pursuits in Kenya, Clearwater will be offering ZeroBase’s proprietary ReGenerator systems for installation throughout the region. Clearwater is also aiming to provide water filtration in the form of ZeroBase’s UF2500 units: portable ultrafiltration systems capable of purifying over two thousand gallons of water per day.

The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings.  The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours.  Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites. When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.","http://www.ice-energy.com","United States","Rutland","null","Vermont","47 Merchants Row","5701","43.6055997922","-72.9790387537","03-10-2013","null","null","null","null","NO","null","null","ISO-NE","null","null","null","1","Ice Energy","null","Ice Energy","Green Mountain Power Energy Innovation Center","Ice Energy","Ice Energy","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Green Mountain Power","null","null","null","null","null","State/Provincial/Regional","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1151.1","Thermal energy storage","Latent heat","Ice","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","10","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Smart Metering – the consumer participates in the energy market A few hundred electricity consumers in the supply area of HSE AG will be obtained with smart meters. These advanced meters provide many innovative functions:  Remote reading of metered values in short term intervals, Reception and visualization of price signals (variable rates) Disturbance signals and management of failures Estimation of manipulations and stolen energy Permanent meter data storage and monitoring of load profiles Supervision and control of distributed power producer, storage and controllable loads Furthermore, they provide gateways to monitor the current demand with the related costs and to further functions of building automation and in-house energy management (smart home). Variable (up to hourly) rates are offered to the clients. Current rates, the rate forecasts and the current demand are monitored. The consumer gets the opportunity to control his demand regarding non time critical loads in accordance with the offered rates. The project Web2Energy is able to achieve experiences with such a practice. The advanced meter technology comes from Landis + Gyr Austria.  2. Smart  Energy Management – Clustering of small power producers  A large number of small independent power producers are supervised and coordinated in such a way that at each moment a scheduled power feeds into the distribution network in accordance with the current demand or the request from the market. Consequently, the deviation of fluctuating wind or solar power from the predictions can be compensated in real-time through the aggregation with controllable generators, loads and storage in the framework of a virtual power plant (VPP). Inside the supply area of the HSE AG this coordination will be applied with benefits. Parallel with a number of volatile of wind power and photovoltaic plants a large number controllable hydro and thermo power plants with cogeneration of heat and power (CHP), storage and controllable industrial loads are in operation. They are able to contribute to the generation and load management. The central operated VPP participates on the markets for energy and control power and optimizes the operations and the overall power in-feed. In this way all participants can achieve higher efficiency and higher compensation of their expenses in comparison with the single market access. To support the VPP operations advanced storage technologies will be established. The EUS GmbH Dortmund implements the VPP procedures. The Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) contributes its experience of market access.  3. Smart Distribution Automation – higher reliability of supply Today supply interruptions happen very rarely. When they do occur, they are caused by 96% in the medium (MV)-/low (LV) voltage distribution networks. In the case of a disturbance an inspection team has to drive along the MV/LV-terminals for disturbance allocation and supply recovery by switching operations. These procedures take on average 1 hour or more. The Web2Energy project implements an automated sequence to execute the former manual processes in a selected area of the HSE AG. This approach cuts the supply interruption down to minutes. Consequently, the very high reliability of supply in Germany will be significantly improved. The necessary control technology comes from iPLS (PL).  Linking the users: All three pillars of smart distribution require the information exchange between the users of the network like consumers, producers, terminals, control centre of the network operator, traders and VPP.  Communication channels have to cover also the last meters to these participants.","http://www.web2energy.com","Germany","Darmstadt","null","Hesse","null","null","49.8776483","8.65","10-09-2013","null","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","null","null","1","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","European Union","null","null","null","null","null","Federal/National","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1184.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","5","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Additionally, the results will inform AESM implementation at Department of Defense (DoD) installations worldwide by providing details of broad-scale capability in providing power quality enhancement, reducing cost of operations, and assuring access to energy for high demand or challenged operations.     MHPCC is a 32,000-square-foot facility that was selected by AFRL-APTO for the AESM demonstration after evaluating its energy demands, existing and planned alternative energy sources, operational requirements, and its ability to meet Air Force energy efficiency and renewable energy efforts.  The facility will be installing roof-mounted solar panels, which will provide insight on storage for excess renewable energy, and instantaneous transition to support an uninterruptable operational environment.     AESM can utilize grid, wind, generator, or solar power for input in a multitude of operations. Furthermore, the control system and energy storage components can be customized to the unique requirements of each operation.     The data and lessons harnessed from the AESM demonstration will determine applicability of the technology to be scalable and transferrable.

Ice Energy’s product, the Ice Bear, attaches to one or more standard 5-20 ton commercial AC units. The Ice Bear freezes ice at night when demand for power is low, capacity is abundant and increasingly sourced from renewables such as wind power. Then during the day, stored ice is used to provide cooling, instead of the power-intensive AC compressor. Ice Bears are deployed in smart-grid enabled, megawatt-scale fleets, and each Ice Bear can reduce harmful CO2 emissions by up to 10 tons per year.

Many of these people live in remote areas where it is not technically or economic infeasible to install an electric energy supply. A good solution is to generate the electricity locally using sustainable sources which are abundant in many of the areas in question, in order to establish a local electricity grid. Alfen recently developed the SOPRA system in order to make this possible.  SOPRA stands for Sustainable Off-grid Power Station for Rural Applications and provides for autonomous energy grids at locations where this was not previously feasible. The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.  The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container. The choice for this type of battery also gives the system a long working life, while the batteries can be simply recycled.  The system works using solar energy, wind energy or water energy, but also with conventional energy sources as backup. The great advantage is that the sustainably generated energy is stored in the battery pack, rather than being lost. Due to various management and communication systems being integrated in the SOPRA concept, users can pay in a number of ways, consumption can be regulated and the system can be remote controlled.

The aim is to realize the benefits of using battery storage on an industrial scale so it can play a key role in the UK energy market as it moves towards a renewable energy future.  A key outcome of the initiative will be the creation of a framework commercial agreement model for use by investors and developers to increase battery storage assets across the UK.  The project is connected to WPD’s South West network and WPD will use the system to peak lop generation to avoid network overloads and voltage excursions, as well as harnessing reactive power from the batteries inverters to reduce voltage rise and using stored energy to support the network at times of high demand.","http://onestepoffthegrid.com.au/western-power-to-take-small-communities-off-grid-with-solar-plus-storage/","Australia","Butleigh","null","Somerset","Copley Wood","null","-33.581611","120.05","01-09-2015","null","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","State/Municipal Owned","null","1","null","null","null","RES (UK)","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Western Power Distribution (Distribution Network Operator) / RES (UK), RES (UK)","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1237.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","10","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The powerhouse would contain four 125 MW reversible pump-turbines capable of lifting water to the upper reservoir or generating power as it flows down. During peak energy demand, water would flow down to generate carbon-free power. During off-peak periods, including daytime when renewable wind and solar power supplies exceed demand, water would be pumped to the upper reservoir.This would be a closed loop, off-stream system in an upland area with no natural water body.

The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building.

The FESS provides first stage response to any grid instabilities (i.e. frequency and ramp rate control) while the BESS is a second stage response if more energy is needed, to assist in avoiding resource curtailment, andto improve the predictability of output. Combining the two technologies has the added benefit of significantly increasing the life of the BESS by reducing its cycle duty while the FESS manages rapid response cycling.

The project serves to assess the performance of flywheel energy storage technology facing the demands of a modern grid environment and special customer requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DuraStorÃ‚Â® by STORNETIC is designed for industrial customers with many charging and discharging cycles. Unlike other storage technologies the flywheel keeps its full capacity over the complete lifetime while combining the advantages of mechanical energy storage, such as sturdiness and endurance, with the advantages of modularity and rapid installation. The device operates purely mechanically - without the use of chemicals - and is made of materials that are fully recyclable. As an innovative short term energy storage solution it enables operators of micro grids around the globe to transform electric energy into rotation energy and store it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ã¢â€šÂ¬4 million euro project, with Ã¢â€šÂ¬2.9 million coming from the EUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Horizon2020 scheme, will develop an innovative flywheel battery hybrid energy storage system aimed at stabilising pressure on the existing grid infrastructure in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flywheels work by accelerating a rotor to high speeds using electrical energy, effectively storing the energy within the system as rotational energy, to be converted back to electricity when required. Flywheels do not degrade over time compared to batteries so combining the two enables the storage system to operate more efficiently and reduce costs over the systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new project, coordinated by Schwungrad Energie Limited, involves partners Adaptive Balancing Power GmbH who will provide their innovative adaptive flywheel technology. Freqcon GmbH will design and build scalable multi-source power converters to connect the flywheels to the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first stage of the project, the flywheel facility will be installed in Ireland, piloted by Schwungrad Energie Limited at their hybrid flywheel battery facility, which has already seen a successful and highly beneficial demonstration project, in collaboration with EirGrid. The flywheel system will be capable of a peak power of 500kW and able to store 10kWh of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system will then be installed at the University of SheffieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2MW battery facility at Willenhall near Wolverhampton. The grid-connected research facility is one of the largest and fastest battery storage systems in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

The funding is supporting the design, build and testing of a pre-commercial LAES technology demonstrator alongside Viridor’s landfill gas generation plant at Pilsworth Landfill facility in Bury, Greater Manchester. In addition to providing energy storage, the LAES plant will convert low-grade waste heat, from the GE Jenbacher landfill gas engines, to power.  The project will operate for at least 1 year and will demonstrate LAES providing a number of balancing services, including Short Term Operating Reserve (STOR), Triad avoidance (supporting the grid during the winter peaks) and testing for the US regulation market. Construction on the project began in February 2015, it is currently in commissioning and is expected to be operational in early 2018.  In August 2017, Highview was awarded £1.5 million of funding by Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation agency for a new hybrid configuration of the existing 5MW liquid air energy storage (LAES) Pre-Commercial Demonstrator. The funding will enable Highview to use supercapacitors and flywheel technology to create the hybrid LAES system. It will demonstrate LAES’s ability to respond to grid frequency events within one second, meeting the requirements of National Grid’s new enhanced frequency response (EFR) service and firm frequency response (FFR) timescales to help keep the UK grid balanced. The aim of the project is to test performance and economics and it will be operational by Summer 2018.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3eOSApOA88  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88CzngeVpDo","http://www.highview-power.com/pre-commercial-laes-technology-demonstrator/","United Kingdom","Bury","null","Lancashire","Pilsworth Power Plant, Moss Hall Road","BL9 7JL","53.5843377","-2.26","02-13-2014","null","02-26-2015","null","null","NO","Primary Distribution","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","Highview Power Storage","null","Highview Power Storage","Highview Power Storage","null","Highview Power Storage","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","Viridor","null","null","null","null","null","Federal/National","null","Federal/National","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1342.1","Thermal energy storage","Latent heat","Liquid air energy storage","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","5000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Participants that sign up to lease SunPower’s solar systems (ranging from 7 kW to 9 kW) will receive a suitably sized battery from Sunverge – the company is offering its 6 kWh and 19.4 kWh storage systems.","http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/sunpower--sunverge-collaborate-on-4-mwh-solarstorage-project-in-new-york_100024988/#axzz4BflnUaOx","United States","Brooklyn","null","New York","null","null","40.6781784","-73.94","06-15-2016","null","null","null","null","NO","Secondary Distribution","null","NYISO","null","Investor Owned","null","1","Sunverge","null","SunPower","null","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Con Edison","null","null","null","null","null","State/Provincial/Regional Grant","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1372.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","1800","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

During normal operations, the solar panels will charge the batteries and provide some of the power to operate the building. When the solar panels are not generating, the batteries can back up the delivery of electricity from Seattle City Light’s distribution grid or, during periods of high demand, could be used to reduce the amount of energy the utility has to purchase to meet customer needs, holding down costs for all its customer-owners. After a storm, earthquake or other emergency, the solar panels, emergency generators and battery system can power a portion of the building even if damage to the distribution grid causes outages in the surrounding area.  “Microgrids show promise for providing backup power during outages, increasing our community’s resiliency after a disaster and making it easier to integrate renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind,” comments Larry Weis, Seattle City Light’s general manager and CEO.  The specific location for the micorgrid has yet to be determined, but Seattle City Light will create a microgrid at a designated emergency shelter, powered by solar energy.

Using open mine pits as reservoirs, the Eagle Mountain Pumped Storage Project will store water in an upper reservoir for later release through an underground power plant to the lower reservoir, generating electricity during peak hours when it is needed most.  The Eagle Mountain Pumped Storage Project will utilize four 325 MW reversible hydroelectric turbines to provide 1300 MW of firm, stable, and dispatchable power when needed. It will provide electricity during the peak electrical demand periods, unexpected generation outages, and help correct and balances in the southwestern grid. Through its ability to store the off-peak energy produced by windmills, solar panels, and baseload nuclear and fossil fuel plants, this single project can accomplish the equivalent of many smaller peak-energy projects.

The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.  The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container. The choice for this type of battery also gives the system a long working life, while the batteries can be simply recycled.  The system works using solar energy, wind energy or water energy, but also with conventional energy sources as backup. The great advantage is that the sustainably generated energy is stored in the battery pack, rather than being lost. Due to various management and communication systems being integrated in the SOPRA concept, users can pay in a number of ways, consumption can be regulated and the system can be remote controlled.

Large-scale operational experiments are being held with Yokohama. The hierarchical bundling of energy management systems (EMS) enables energy management at the level of individual EMS and demand-side management at the level of the overall system.  One of the most unique undertakings of the Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) is the storage battery SCADA. SCADA stands for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition and is a device monitoring and control system. The storage battery SCADA uses multiple storage batteries as one massive virtual battery to control battery charging and discharging. This type of system is nearly unprecedented anywhere in the world, and creating the system has made it possible to achieve moderated demand response (DR).  Participating in the project are Toshiba Corporation, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Incorporated, Hitachi, Ltd., Meidensha Corporation, NEC Corporation, Sharp Corporation, and Sony Energy Devices Corporation.                              Two types of batteries are controlled by the storage battery SCADA: large batteries used to adjust electric power supply and demand; and stationary batteries used in homes, commercial buildings, and so on. The batteries used for supply and demand adjustments are lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Toshiba (300 kW), Hitachi (100 kW), and NEC and Meidensha Corporation through joint development (200 kW), providing total output of 600 kW. Batteries designed for users were installed in homes and commercial buildings by Sony Energy Devices, and batteries for office buildings in Yokohama were installed by Sharp. The storage battery SCADA performs three types of functions to control these batteries: daily operation, short-cycle supply and demand adjustment, and reserve power operation. The moderated DR mentioned above is achieved by daily operation. Specifically, the storage battery SCADA sends inquiries to home and commercial building users about their spare battery capacity on the following day. The responses received indicate how much spare capacity is available and when, as well as indicating that operations of a certain type are planned for a specific time, and therefore the remaining capacity may be used freely. Based on these responses, the storage battery SCADA borrows the spare capacity of user batteries and charges the batteries from the power grid at times when power demand is relatively low. The power company estimates the shortfall in electric power compared to the amount of power needed at peak times based on daily demand forecasts and supply plans. The storage battery SCADA receives requests from the power company, gathers spare battery capacity equal to the amount of the shortfall, and stores power. In addition, when sending inquiries about spare capacity to users, the system also asks how much the users want to be paid per kilowatt hour as an incentive (payment is made for capacity actually used in 30-minute increments). The storage battery SCADA selects batteries in homes and commercial buildings up to the required storage capacity starting with the lowest incentives. In this way, the electric power company can provide the necessary power by discharging batteries when electricity supply and demand is tight. The second function, short-cycle supply and demand adjustment, is a method of using supply and demand adjustment batteries to make up for the shortfall in short-cycle adjustment capacity provided by thermal electricity generation and hydroelectric power resulting from the introduction of renewable energy, which is subject to output fluctuations. Load frequency control is performed. The third function, reserve power operation, discharges supply and demand adjustment batteries during emergencies such as when an accident occurs to the power grid in order to minimize the effects of the accident.","http://jscp.nepc.or.jp/article/jscpen/20140326/389815/index.shtml","Japan","Yokohama","null","Kanagawa","null","null","35","140","03-27-2014","null","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","null","null","1","Toshiba, Hitachi, NEC, Meidensha Corporation","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","Consortium of Companies","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1527.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","600","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The new technology allows to maintain momentary power balance more efficiently.  KPX said the new technology will provide benefits of improving operation of electric power systems and creating new businesses as it allows thermal power plants to reduce cost factors in regulating frequency.  And, it will enable power generation companies to minimize high-cost LNG-fired power generation by increasing use of low-cost power generation, while avoiding construction of additional power plants needed for securing power reserves. It will also reduce emission of pollutant (yellow plume) and allow companies to reduce consumption of high-priced batteries thanks to ESS-based short cycle service.  Moreover, it will enable low cost power plant, which is in output cutback operation to regulate frequency, to conduct fixed output operation by 100% by storing power of electric power systems in ESSs when frequency rises and discharging stored power when frequency drops. It is analyzed that companies will be able to drastically reduce power generation costs in this way.  In conjunction with 10 companies, including Hyosung, SK Innovation, LG Chem, LSIS, KPX plans to carry forward the project of developing technologies and systems needed for introducing ESS-based frequency regulation service (project title: Development of ESS operating system for regulating frequency of electric power systems and electric power market system) for three years(2013~2016), investing a total of 21.5 billion won (10 billion won by the government and 11.5 billion won by private sector).","http://energy.korea.com/archives/56339","South Korea","Yeosu-si","null","Jeollanam-do","280 Wolnae-dong","null","34.8533747","127.73","03-27-2014","null","null","null","null","NO","null","null","","null","null","null","1","SK Innovation","Hyosung Corporation","Hyosung Corporation","null","null","null","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","Korea Power Exchange (KPX)","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1529.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","4000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

Ore is extracted from 1,000 meters underground with a large, electrically driven winder, which at 8.5 megawatts (MW) of demand shift over 120 seconds is a large cyclic load, given the unitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s average power consumption is just 2 MW. To upgrade the winderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power supply, BHP installed a 1 MW PowerStore system, which reduced the total demand shift to 6.5 MW while adding 1 MW of spinning reserve to the system. Its flywheel-based energy storage system provides peak lopping and overcomes transient and cyclic loads on grid connected or isolated systems. The mine was able to increase winder production without affecting power system reliability. Fully automated, PowerStore gets power to the winder when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needed most, and provides high resolution data of winder performance and local electrical grid disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PowerStore is a compact and versatile flywheel-based grid stabilizing generator. Its main purpose is to stabilize power systems against fluctuations in frequency and voltage. It includes state-of-the-art inverters and virtual generator control software. It enables the integration of intermittent and often erratic renewable generation and the higher utilization of renewable energy generators, protecting remote communities from exposure to volatile oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore safeguards conventional microgrids, and ensures the safe integration of large amounts of wind and solar energy, reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. High-speed software controls the power flow into and out of the flywheel, essentially making it a high inertia electrical shock absorber that can instantly smooth out power fluctuations generated by wind turbines or solar arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore acts like a STATCOM (advanced grid technology that quickly stabilizes voltage and improves power quality) and in addition is capable of rapidly absorbing or injecting real power within an isolated power network. It can stabilize both voltage and frequency, hold 18 MWs (megawatt seconds) of energy and shift from full absorption to full injection in 1 millisecond to stabilize the grid.&lt;/p&gt;","http://www.ferret.com.au/c/PowerCorp/New-energy-storage-system-boosts-peak-power-to-Leinster-s-underground-winder-n689054","Australia","Leinster","null","Western Australia","null","null","-27.9128383","120.6973818","null","null","01-01-2005","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","ABB","ABB","null","null","null","null","null","null","Customer-Owned","null","BHP Billiton","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1605.1","Electro-mechanical energy storage","Flywheel","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","1000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

It's part of Shedd's Master Energy Roadmap plan, a green initiative started in 2012. In addition to the installation of the giant battery, the plan calls for replacing 75 percent of the aquarium’s lights with high efficiency LED lights and implementing enhanced automation systems that can adjust electricity use based on real-time shifts in electricity pricing. The $2 million battery will generate revenue for the Shedd by maintaining the area's electrical grid at a frequency of 60 hertz for the regional transmission organization PJM, which manages the grid. For example, if it's a cloudy day and the city's solar panels aren't generating enough electricity, the battery will distribute extra power. It will also serve as emergency back-up power for the Shedd.  The massive battery is visible to visitors from the loading dock outside or through the south Abbott Oceanarium window inside. The battery, along with an adjoining transformer and inverter skid, were funded in part by a $500,000 grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (IDCEO) and installed by Schneider Electric.

The Project will prevent the emission of approximately 870,000 tons of CO2 per year and will contribute to meet the growing energy demand from households and industries by combining both technologies.  The CSP Cerro Dominador is a plant with solar thermal tower technology that uses a series of 10,600 heliostats that track the sun on two axes, concentrating the solar radiation onto a single point on the upper part of the tower. Each heliostat consists of 32 individual mirrors that reach 1507 square feet. At the receiver the heat is transferred to the molten salts. In a heat exchanger, the molten salts transfer their heat to a water stream to generate superheated and reheated steam, which powers a turbine capable of generating around 110 MW of power.","https://cerrodominador.com/proyecto/solar-thermal-plant/?lang=en","Chile","Calama","null","II Región de Antofagasta","null","null","-22.453712","-68.93","null","null","05-20-2014","null","null","NO","null","null","CDEC-SING","null","null","null","1","Abengoa Solar","null","null","null","Abengoa Solar","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","Abengoa Solar Chile","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1655.1","Thermal energy storage","Sensible heat","Molten salt","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","110000","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

All major car manufacturers have announced to launch an electric vehicle. The Dutch market is expected to expand to 15,000-20,000 EVs in 2013, and 1,000,000 EVs in 2025. The ambition of the Dutch government is to have 200,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020, and a continued growth to a mature market of 1 million vehicles by 2025. For scaling up the number of electric vehicles, a charging infrastructure with 500 fast charging points is essential.   However, anxiety regarding range and finding charging stations can be a major concern for EV drivers; this range anxiety can be alleviated with the availability of fast charging stations at central locations, where a car gets fully charged within 30 minutes. The availability of fast charging stations plays a major role in the acceptance by a broad group of consumers.  An important technical challenge related to electric vehicles is the effect of charging on the classic energy grid. Moreover, the classic energy grid is not suited for fast charging of EVs, as this is accompanied by very high peaks in energy demand. Innovative solutions should be developed to overcome this problem.  MisterGreen aims at developing an important next step for electric transportation: sustainable fast charging stations next to Dutch highway gas stations, where electric cars get fully charged in 30 minutes using solar energy. MisterGreen aims at developing a smart-grid solution – the energy needed for fast-charging is available via energy storage buffer batteries. There will be no peak energy demands on the classic energy grid as these batteries serve as energy buffer. The storage buffer batteries are charged using solar panels. A lack of available solar power can be supplemented by power from the grid.   Mistergreen will realize and manage a nationwide network of fast charging stations at the best locations in the Netherlands. Concessions for twenty highway locations throughout the Netherlands have been obtained until 2027. The fast charging stations will be realized next to gas stations along the highway in the Netherlands.  Intergrated solar panels for onsite electricity generation will charge the batteries of the charging station. Both the battery storage and grid power provide for fast charging the EV. The battery storage pack will serve as a load-balancing power source and has smart grid functionalities.  At these highway fast charging stations, drivers can fill up their car with sustainable solar energy in less than 30 minutes.  Haarrijn, the largest petrol station in Europe located centrally in the Netherlands will be the first demonstration/pilot location of the EV fast charging station.","http://www.mistergreen.nl","Netherlands","Breukelen","null","Utrecht","Rijksweg A2 bij Breukelen","null","52.171959","5.002675","null","null","10-10-2013","null","null","NO","Transmission","null","","null","Investor Owned","null","1","Alfen","Alfen","null","MisterGreen Products","Alfen","null","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","MisterGreen Electric Lease","null","null","null","null","null","Private/Third Party Equity","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1672.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","Lithium-iron phosphate battery","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","50","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

It is one of the first deployments of battery technology aimed at such a large-scale shifting of power in a behind-the-meter setting.","http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131029006428/en/California%E2%80%99s-Discovery-Science-Center-Selects-GE-Energy","United States","Santa Ana","null","California","2500 N Main St","92705","33.7494951","-117.8732213","null","null","04-14-2014","null","null","NO","null","null","CAISO","null","Investor Owned","null","1","GE Energy Storage","Princeton Power Systems","Princeton Power Systems","Southern California Edison","null","null","null","null","Utility-Owned","null","Southern California Edison, Discovery Science Center","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1673.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Sodium-based battery","Sodium-nickel-chloride battery","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","100","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"

The project will consist of three Alevo GridBank inorganic lithium ion energy storage systems and six Parker-Hannifin 890- GTB Power Conversion Systems (PCS). Alevo will also provide ongoing management and operations and maintenance services for the life of the project.  The 10 MW project will consist of three GridBank enclosures and will provide fast responding regulation services (FRRS) as an open market participant in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an independent system operator that manages the flow of electric power to Texas customers. The project represents an evolution of the Texas market, which has more wind installed than any other state and has a rapidly expanding base of installed solar energy projects.","https://apnews.com/26552224a94255b96e3894500b520948","United States","Georgetown","null","Texas","null","null","30.6332618","-97.68","03-30-2016","04-30-2020","null","null","null","NO","null","null","ERCOT","null","Public Owned","null","1","Viridity Energy","null","null","null","Viridity Energy","Viridity Energy","null","null","Third-Party-Owned","null","Ormat Technologies","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Subsystem 1","1691.1","Electro-chemical battery and chemical storage","Lithium-ion battery","","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","9900","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"
